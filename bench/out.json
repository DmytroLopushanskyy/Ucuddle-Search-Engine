  "inline_text": "“Those who complete the requirements for the performance and pedagogy degree are prepared for professional work as a performer, a studio teacher, or a combination of both. Some will pursue advanced work on the graduate level to prepare for a performance career or college teaching.” (Brigham Young University Bulletin: 1992-93 General Catalogue, p. 228.) \n Aside from the basic music core requirements, undergraduate majors in organ performance and pedagogy receive intensive training in organ performance, registration, keyboard skills, accompanying and ensemble performance, organ pedagogy (teaching), organ literature, and church music playing skills. Those pursuing a dual emphasis in piano and organ also study piano performance, literature, and pedagogy. The baccalaureate degrees are designed as four-year programs. \n Graduate students in organ performance and pedagogy receive training in music research techniques, organ performance, ensemble performance, organ literature, advanced keyboard harmony, organ pedagogy and supervised teaching, and church service playing skills. The master’s degree is designed as a 2-year program. \n One may pursue a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in Music with organ as the primary instrument. However, only the Bachelor of Music (B.M.) degree is offered in performance and pedagogy with an emphasis in organ. \n The Bachelor of Music in Performance and Pedagogy leads to the Master of Music in Performance and Pedagogy at BYU and equivalent performance-oriented master’s degree programs at universities, music schools and conservatories throughout the country. In addition, it qualifies as a prerequisite for master’s degree programs in music education, musicology, and composition. \n The Master of Music in Performance and Pedagogy serves as a prerequisite for the Doctor of Musical Arts degree and for many Ph.D. programs in music. \n “The music major may pursue a broad liberal education with a concentration in music or specialize in an area such as composition, performance, or teaching. Those who successfully complete an undergraduate degree are prepared to obtain a number of professional positions within the field of music or to continue music on the graduate level.

Some will pursue advanced work on the graduate level to prepare for a performance career or college teaching.” (Brigham Young University Bulletin: 1992-93 General Catalogue, p. 228.)\nAside from the basic music core requirements, undergraduate majors in organ performance and pedagogy receive intensive training in organ performance, registration, keyboard skills, accompanying and ensemble performance, organ pedagogy (teaching), organ literature, and church music playing skills. Those pursuing a dual emphasis in piano and organ also study piano performance, literature, and pedagogy. The baccalaureate degrees are designed as four-year programs.\nGraduate students in organ performance and pedagogy receive training in music research techniques, organ performance, ensemble performance, organ literature, advanced keyboard harmony, organ pedagogy and supervised teaching, and church service playing skills. The master’s degree is designed as a 2-year program.\nOne may pursue a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in Music with organ as the primary instrument. However, only the Bachelor of Music (B.M.) degree is offered in performance and pedagogy with an emphasis in organ.\nOrgan as a Foundation for Advanced Music Degrees\nThe Bachelor of Music in Performance and Pedagogy leads to the Master of Music in Performance and Pedagogy at BYU and equivalent performance-oriented master’s degree programs at universities, music schools and conservatories throughout the country. In addition, it qualifies as a prerequisite for master’s degree programs in music education, musicology, and composition.\nThe Master of Music in Performance and Pedagogy serves as a prerequisite for the Doctor of Musical Arts degree and for many Ph.D. programs in music.\nOrgan as a Foundation for Advanced Non-Music Degrees\n“The music major may pursue a broad liberal education with a concentration in music or specialize in an area such as composition, performance, or teaching. Those who successfully complete an undergraduate degree are prepared to obtain a number of professional positions within the field of music or to continue music on the graduate level. Because the music curriculum is rigorous, it is an excellent pre-professional course of study for those interested in fields such as arts administration, business, law, librarianship, the music industry, music journalism, and music therapy.” (Brigham Young University Bulletin: 1992-93 General Catalogue, p. 228.)\nA degree in organ performance and pedagogy is an excellent undergraduate preparation for the many non-music graduate degrees.

  "inline_text": "The organ performance degree provides training in both performance and in teaching. The degree holder is qualified to offer private organ instruction–a service demanded in every community. The degree offers assurance to prospective students that the teacher has gained sufficient knowledge and experience in organ to provide quality instruction. \n The organ performance degree holder has a large pool of potential organ students in most communities. The large numbers of young people who study the piano gain note-reading fluency and other fundamental musical skills needed in organ playing. Young musicians are fascinated by the versatility and power of the organ, and the opportunity to broaden their musical experience through organ study is attractive to many of them. The more experienced pianists and organists welcome the insight and the energy that a new organ graduate has to offer. An organist willing to offer recitals, seminars, and other musical services may earn the respect and trust of the musical public, resulting in dedicated private students. \n One who develops performance and teaching skills in both piano and organ will find an even larger pool of potential students. The B.M. with a dual emphasis in organ and piano is an excellent degree choice for one whose career goals center around private teaching. \n Some opportunities exist for teaching at the college and university levels. Competition for these positions is keen, but those who continue organ study to the master’s and doctoral levels find part- or full-time teaching positions especially rewarding. The B.M. and M.M. offer excellent training and opportunities in performance and teaching, in preparation for the advanced graduate work required to qualify for these positions. \n Many churches require an organist, usually on a part-time basis. One may find great musical satisfaction as well as steady income in such work. \n Community- and school-sponsored musical organizations occasionally require the services of an organist as an accompanist. While these opportunities rarely provide regular income, the organist who satisfies will be re-invited as needs arise. Excellent opportunities for experience in choir and solo accompaniment exist at BYU, providing fine preparation for one interested in work as an accompanist or church organist. \n For all of these income and career opportunities, organists are favored who not only hold degrees, but who work well and pleasantly with people, who demand excellence of their own work, and who are versatile in their skills. All of these important qualities are encouraged at BYU as an integral part of the organ performance degree programs.On Campus Students\n\n\tMusic Majors\n\t\n\t\tDegree Programs\n\t\tCareer and Income Opportunities\n\t\tAdmissions and Scholarship\n\t\tStudents\n\t\n\n\tNon-Music Majors\n\t\n\t\tGroup Organ Study\n\t\tPrivate Organ Study\n\t\tOrgan Registration\n\t\n\n\n \n Music Majors\n\t\n\t\tDegree Programs\n\t\tCareer and Income Opportunities\n\t\tAdmissions and Scholarship\n\t\tStudents\n\t\n \n Degree Programs \n Career and Income Opportunities \n Admissions and Scholarship \n Students \n Non-Music Majors\n\t\n\t\tGroup Organ Study\n\t\tPrivate Organ Study\n\t\tOrgan Registration\n\t\n \n Group Organ Study \n Private Organ Study \n Organ Registration \n Off Campus Students\n\n\tFinding An Organ Teacher\n\tBYU Programs for Off-Campus Organists (Organ Certification)\n\t\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 1-2\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 3-6\n\t\tRepertoire for BYU Independent Study Organ Courses\n\t\n\n\tContinuing Your Organ Training PDF\n\tMaterials Needed For Independent Study Organ Classes PDF\n\tBYU Organ Workshop\n\tOrganTutor\n\tMentor Instructions\n\n \n Finding An Organ Teacher \n BYU Programs for Off-Campus Organists (Organ Certification)\n\t\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 1-2\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 3-6\n\t\tRepertoire for BYU Independent Study Organ Courses\n\t\n \n Independent Study Organ Levels 1-2 \n Independent Study Organ Levels 3-6 \n Repertoire for BYU Independent Study Organ Courses \n Continuing Your Organ Training PDF \n Materials Needed For Independent Study Organ Classes PDF \n BYU Organ Workshop \n OrganTutor \n Mentor Instructions \n Events\n\n\tBYU Organ Workshop\n\tPipe Organ Study Tour of Germany\n\tAGO Events\n\t\n\t\tUtah Valley Chapter AGO\n\t\tSalt Lake City Chapter AGO\n\t\n\n\n \n BYU Organ Workshop \n Pipe Organ Study Tour of Germany \n AGO Events\n\t\n\t\tUtah Valley Chapter AGO\n\t\tSalt Lake City Chapter AGO\n\t\n \n Utah Valley Chapter AGO \n Salt Lake City Chapter AGO \n Ward Organists\n\n\tThe New Ward Organist\n\tWard Organist Training\n\t\n\t\tOrgan Training Outlines\n\t\n\n\tTraveling Organ Workshops\n\tOrgan Training Resources PDF\n\tU of U Group Organ Instruction\n\tUsing OrganTutor PDF\n\tFree Accompaniment PDF\n\n \n The New Ward Organist \n Ward Organist Training\n\t\n\t\tOrgan Training Outlines\n\t\n \n Organ Training Outlines \n Traveling Organ Workshops \n Organ Training Resources PDF \n U of U Group Organ Instruction \n Using OrganTutor PDF \n Free Accompaniment PDF \n Workshops\n\n\tOnline Training Sessions\n\t2021 BYU Organ Workshop\n\tTraveling Organ Workshops\n\n \n Online Training Sessions \n 2021 BYU Organ Workshop \n Traveling Organ Workshops \n Info \u0026 Reference\n\n\tOrgan Training Resources PDF\n\tCarol Dean\n\tContinuing Your Organ Training\n\tDouglas E.

Young musicians are fascinated by the versatility and power of the organ, and the opportunity to broaden their musical experience through organ study is attractive to many of them. The more experienced pianists and organists welcome the insight and the energy that a new organ graduate has to offer. An organist willing to offer recitals, seminars, and other musical services may earn the respect and trust of the musical public, resulting in dedicated private students.\nOne who develops performance and teaching skills in both piano and organ will find an even larger pool of potential students. The B.M. with a dual emphasis in organ and piano is an excellent degree choice for one whose career goals center around private teaching.\nSome opportunities exist for teaching at the college and university levels. Competition for these positions is keen, but those who continue organ study to the master’s and doctoral levels find part- or full-time teaching positions especially rewarding. The B.M. and M.M. offer excellent training and opportunities in performance and teaching, in preparation for the advanced graduate work required to qualify for these positions.\nMany churches require an organist, usually on a part-time basis. One may find great musical satisfaction as well as steady income in such work.\nCommunity- and school-sponsored musical organizations occasionally require the services of an organist as an accompanist. While these opportunities rarely provide regular income, the organist who satisfies will be re-invited as needs arise. Excellent opportunities for experience in choir and solo accompaniment exist at BYU, providing fine preparation for one interested in work as an accompanist or church organist.\nFor all of these income and career opportunities, organists are favored who not only hold degrees, but who work well and pleasantly with people, who demand excellence of their own work, and who are versatile in their skills. All of these important qualities are encouraged at BYU as an integral part of the organ performance degree programs.\n",

  "inline_text": " \n When you enroll in Group Organ study at Brigham Young University, you become part of an innovative and highly successful program. Since the installation of the Group Organ studio in 1988, over 2000 pianists, anticipating an eventual opportunity to serve the church as an organist, have learned the basics of organ playing through these courses. It is an excellent way to enhance the quality of your service to the Church through music. At the same time, you learn basic skills needed to begin exploring concert organ music. \n “Basic Organ Skills” (Music 115) offers assistance in developing the basic organ playing skills, knowledge, and judgement necessary for one to function confidently and satisfactorily in a worship service. Previous piano experience is necessary, as this class assumes that students can read music and play easier hymns at the piano without difficulty. Those who have little or no piano experience should complete two semesters of Group Piano Instruction (Music 113) to prepare for Basic Organ Skills. Recognizing the wide range of musical backgrounds represented by the students enrolled in each section, the course is designed to teach the same basic skills to everyone, but at the same time to encourage those who are able to move faster into additional and more challenging repertoire. \n “Organ Techniques and Literature” (Music 116R) develops further the skills introduced in Basic Organ Skills, and covers more advanced concepts and skills in hymn playing, registration, interpretation, and organ literature. Emphasis is made to encourage the individual to learn at his/her own pace, through the establishment and working out of a “semester plan” that includes hymns, organ literature, and accompaniments. In addition, the tools used by the creative organist to encourage and enhance congregational singing are introduced. Due to the individualization of the course structure, Organ Techniques and Literature may be repeated for credit. \n Both group organ courses described above offer a less expensive alternative to private organ study, as there is no fee charged above the normal tuition costs.On Campus Students\n\n\tMusic Majors\n\t\n\t\tDegree Programs\n\t\tCareer and Income Opportunities\n\t\tAdmissions and Scholarship\n\t\tStudents\n\t\n\n\tNon-Music Majors\n\t\n\t\tGroup Organ Study\n\t\tPrivate Organ Study\n\t\tOrgan Registration\n\t\n\n\n \n Music Majors\n\t\n\t\tDegree Programs\n\t\tCareer and Income Opportunities\n\t\tAdmissions and Scholarship\n\t\tStudents\n\t\n \n Degree Programs \n Career and Income Opportunities \n Admissions and Scholarship \n Students \n Non-Music Majors\n\t\n\t\tGroup Organ Study\n\t\tPrivate Organ Study\n\t\tOrgan Registration\n\t\n \n Group Organ Study \n Private Organ Study \n Organ Registration \n Off Campus Students\n\n\tFinding An Organ Teacher\n\tBYU Programs for Off-Campus Organists (Organ Certification)\n\t\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 1-2\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 3-6\n\t\tRepertoire for BYU Independent Study Organ Courses\n\t\n\n\tContinuing Your Organ Training PDF\n\tMaterials Needed For Independent Study Organ Classes PDF\n\tBYU Organ Workshop\n\tOrganTutor\n\tMentor Instructions\n\n \n Finding An Organ Teacher \n BYU Programs for Off-Campus Organists (Organ Certification)\n\t\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 1-2\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 3-6\n\t\tRepertoire for BYU Independent Study Organ Courses\n\t\n \n Independent Study Organ Levels 1-2 \n Independent Study Organ Levels 3-6 \n Repertoire for BYU Independent Study Organ Courses \n Continuing Your Organ Training PDF \n Materials Needed For Independent Study Organ Classes PDF \n BYU Organ Workshop \n OrganTutor \n Mentor Instructions \n Events\n\n\tBYU Organ Workshop\n\tPipe Organ Study Tour of Germany\n\tAGO Events\n\t\n\t\tUtah Valley Chapter AGO\n\t\tSalt Lake City Chapter AGO\n\t\n\n\n \n BYU Organ Workshop \n Pipe Organ Study Tour of Germany \n AGO Events\n\t\n\t\tUtah Valley Chapter AGO\n\t\tSalt Lake City Chapter AGO\n\t\n \n Utah Valley Chapter AGO \n Salt Lake City Chapter AGO \n Ward Organists\n\n\tThe New Ward Organist\n\tWard Organist Training\n\t\n\t\tOrgan Training Outlines\n\t\n\n\tTraveling Organ Workshops\n\tOrgan Training Resources PDF\n\tU of U Group Organ Instruction\n\tUsing OrganTutor PDF\n\tFree Accompaniment PDF\n\n \n The New Ward Organist \n Ward Organist Training\n\t\n\t\tOrgan Training Outlines\n\t\n \n Organ Training Outlines \n Traveling Organ Workshops \n Organ Training Resources PDF \n U of U Group Organ Instruction \n Using OrganTutor PDF \n Free Accompaniment PDF \n Workshops\n\n\tOnline Training Sessions\n\t2021 BYU Organ Workshop\n\tTraveling Organ Workshops\n\n \n Online Training Sessions \n 2021 BYU Organ Workshop \n Traveling Organ Workshops \n Info \u0026 Reference\n\n\tOrgan Training Resources PDF\n\tCarol Dean\n\tContinuing Your Organ Training\n\tDouglas E.

Weekly 30-minute lessons allow the student more flexibility and personal attention in details of hymn playing, technique, interpretation, registration, etc. An additional fee of $270 per semester is charged. Students enrolled in Private Organ Study are given a keypad number and permitted to practice in the pipe organ practice rooms on the first and second floors of the Harris Fine Arts Center.

Traditional instruction is offered through books and computer lessons, while performance instruction is coordinated with qualified organ instructors in the vicinity of the student. \n These courses are a multi-level, in-depth organ training program created by the BYU organ faculty. Each of the six levels/courses (organ.byu.edu/TrainingResources.pdf) is available in both college-credit and non-credit versions. College-credit versions (Music 399R Sections 1-6 (http://is.byu.edu/site/courses/index.cfm?school=univ) offer between 2 and 5 hours of college credit (fee: $386-$965) and a certificate of completion. Non-credit “Continuing Education” versions (Music 71-76) offer a certificate of completion but no college credit ($150 per course). Visit elearn.byu.edu, and then click Catalog \u003e Continuing Education Courses, and then find Organ Performance, Level 1, etc. Free versions are available for Levels 1 and 2 only, offering neither college credit nor a certificate. Visit elearn.byu.edu, and then click Catalog \u003e Free Courses \u003e Music 071 or Music 072. \n The courses begin at Level 1 with basic organ skills for the pianist, and end at Level 6 at the point of readiness for the Colleague and Service Playing certificates of the American Guild of Organists. Visit https://www.agohq.org/certification/. \n Students, in consultation with their instructors, enroll at the level that best suits their needs. Up to one year is allowed to pass the requirements for that level. Upon passing, students may enroll for the next level. In the free versions of Levels 1 and 2, students are welcome to pick and choose the topics that they wish. \n Each level presents two types of instruction: 1) written assignments and exams on organ technique, organ registration, and music theory, and 2) played assignments on specified exercises, organ repertoire, hymn playing, sight-reading, transposition, and accompaniment. The written assignments are graded by computer. Students may pass off the played assignments with an approved evaluator or possibly with a member of the BYU organ faculty. Some may be submitted by video recording. To see a summary of the requirements for Levels 1-2, visit http://www.organ.byu.edu/orgcertlev1-2.pdf. For levels 3-6, visit http://www.organ.byu.edu/orgcertlev3-6.pdf. \n Seek out a qualified organ instructor to meet with as often as needed to help you complete the course requirements. In addition, instruction customized for each level is offered during the BYU Organ Workshop (see below). Other instructional materials are available at http://organ.byu.edu/. The cost for the instructor and course materials is in addition to any course fees. \n For more information, follow the links above, visit http://organ.byu.edu, or email indstudy@byu.edu. \n The BYU Organ Workshop offers four days of instruction in organ playing skills.  Up to five classes are scheduled every hour to meet the needs of beginning to advanced organists.  Whether you use your skills in the church service, for teaching, or for your own enjoyment, you will be taught and encouraged by more than a dozen seasoned instructors. \n Supervised Practice Sessions (no fee) and Private Instruction ($25-40) provide an opportunity to play hymns or organ pieces for an instructor and receive personalized feedback, instruction, and motivation.  Most organists prepare hymns or organ repertoire pieces from the six Independent Study organ levels (visit the web site for a detailed list of requirements at each level), but any form of organ performance preparation is acceptable. \n Return home from this intensive workshop with the seeds of new skills and with the motivation to follow through with organ study throughout the year.  Use this workshop as a springboard for lifelong learning in organ.  If you wish, enroll in a BYU Independent Study organ course (see above) to help you along during the year.  Return the following year and take workshop classes that will prepare you for the next level of study.  The fee is $250-$290. \n For more information, visit \u003chttp://organworkshop.byu.edu\u003e, call 801-422-7692, or email ce.@byu.edu. \n The BYU Young Musicians SummerFestival is a workshop for young instrumentalists and vocalists ages 14–18 who want to improve their musical skills and talents. It is a six-day musical experience with instruction in more than 20 instruments, including voice. Instruction is by School of Music faculty and guest instructors, and is offered at the beginning level for pianists who want to study organ, and also at the intermediate and advanced levels. Several BYU organ majors have began their organ studies with the SummerFestival. \n Workshop Package: $440 (includes daily lunch), plus optional food and housing package $235 (housing and all meals). Counselors provide excellent supervision.  \n For more information, visit \u003chttp://summerfestival.byu.edu\u003e, call 801-422-7692, or email young_musicians@byu.edu. \n dc 5/19On Campus Students\n\n\tMusic Majors\n\t\n\t\tDegree Programs\n\t\tCareer and Income Opportunities\n\t\tAdmissions and Scholarship\n\t\tStudents\n\t\n\n\tNon-Music Majors\n\t\n\t\tGroup Organ Study\n\t\tPrivate Organ Study\n\t\tOrgan Registration\n\t\n\n\n \n Music Majors\n\t\n\t\tDegree Programs\n\t\tCareer and Income Opportunities\n\t\tAdmissions and Scholarship\n\t\tStudents\n\t\n \n Degree Programs \n Career and Income Opportunities \n Admissions and Scholarship \n Students \n Non-Music Majors\n\t\n\t\tGroup Organ Study\n\t\tPrivate Organ Study\n\t\tOrgan Registration\n\t\n \n Group Organ Study \n Private Organ Study \n Organ Registration \n Off Campus Students\n\n\tFinding An Organ Teacher\n\tBYU Programs for Off-Campus Organists (Organ Certification)\n\t\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 1-2\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 3-6\n\t\tRepertoire for BYU Independent Study Organ Courses\n\t\n\n\tContinuing Your Organ Training PDF\n\tMaterials Needed For Independent Study Organ Classes PDF\n\tBYU Organ Workshop\n\tOrganTutor\n\tMentor Instructions\n\n \n Finding An Organ Teacher \n BYU Programs for Off-Campus Organists (Organ Certification)\n\t\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 1-2\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 3-6\n\t\tRepertoire for BYU Independent Study Organ Courses\n\t\n \n Independent Study Organ Levels 1-2 \n Independent Study Organ Levels 3-6 \n Repertoire for BYU Independent Study Organ Courses \n Continuing Your Organ Training PDF \n Materials Needed For Independent Study Organ Classes PDF \n BYU Organ Workshop \n OrganTutor \n Mentor Instructions \n Events\n\n\tBYU Organ Workshop\n\tPipe Organ Study Tour of Germany\n\tAGO Events\n\t\n\t\tUtah Valley Chapter AGO\n\t\tSalt Lake City Chapter AGO\n\t\n\n\n \n BYU Organ Workshop \n Pipe Organ Study Tour of Germany \n AGO Events\n\t\n\t\tUtah Valley Chapter AGO\n\t\tSalt Lake City Chapter AGO\n\t\n \n Utah Valley Chapter AGO \n Salt Lake City Chapter AGO \n Ward Organists\n\n\tThe New Ward Organist\n\tWard Organist Training\n\t\n\t\tOrgan Training Outlines\n\t\n\n\tTraveling Organ Workshops\n\tOrgan Training Resources PDF\n\tU of U Group Organ Instruction\n\tUsing OrganTutor PDF\n\tFree Accompaniment PDF\n\n \n The New Ward Organist \n Ward Organist Training\n\t\n\t\tOrgan Training Outlines\n\t\n \n Organ Training Outlines \n Traveling Organ Workshops \n Organ Training Resources PDF \n U of U Group Organ Instruction \n Using OrganTutor PDF \n Free Accompaniment PDF \n Workshops\n\n\tOnline Training Sessions\n\t2021 BYU Organ Workshop\n\tTraveling Organ Workshops\n\n \n Online Training Sessions \n 2021 BYU Organ Workshop \n Traveling Organ Workshops \n Info \u0026 Reference\n\n\tOrgan Training Resources PDF\n\tCarol Dean\n\tContinuing Your Organ Training\n\tDouglas E.

  "inline_text": "THE BYU INDEPENDENT STUDY ORGAN COURSES FOR PERSONAL ENRICHMENT \n The organ courses for Personal Enrichment in the BYU Independent Study program are non-credit courses designed to provide motivation, direction, and instruction for organists to improve their skills in specific areas: organ technique, organ repertoire, hymn playing, music theory, organ registration, and sight-reading (college-credit versions are also available).  You have been selected by the BYU organ faculty to serve as a mentor to one of these organists through three played assignments.  In all your dealings with each organist, please remember the following: \n There are two tracks for each course: a Self Study track, and a Certification track. \n The Self Study track is designed to make limited or no use of BYU mentors, faculty, or Independent Study resources. \n The Certification track offers a certificate of completion from the BYU organ faculty, which requires that we assure that high standards are being reached by the certifying student.  The Certification track makes greater use of the mentor in checking those standards and in providing valuable feedback to the student and the organ faculty. \n In either track, EVALUATORS (and you may serve as the evaluator) are paid directly by the student on a per-item basis, as described below. MENTORS (certification track only) are paid by the School of Music. \n PLAYED ASSIGNMENTS \n Each course includes three played assignments. Beginning with played assignment 1, students prepare by practicing the organ technique, organ repertoire, hymns, and sight-reading items required for that assignment.  (Note: Speedback lessons 1 and 2 should be completed during this same time.)  This process usually requires several weeks or months. \n The simplest way to complete the assignments is as follows:  Early in the process, the student makes a copy of the played assignment evaluation forms included with the course instructions and gives them to the teacher. \n The student’s teacher keeps a record of the requirements as the student completes them during lessons. \n In the Self Study track, the teacher returns each form to the organist as it is completed, and the mentor is not involved. \n In the Certification track, after each assignment is complete, the teacher should return a copy of the form by mail, or a summary of his or her evaluation by email to the BYU graduate student mentor.  The mentor will review this evaluation and report to Dr. Don Cook (the BYU organ faculty member) via email.  There is no fee paid to the mentor for this type of evaluation and communication.  Dr. Cook will then post the credit to the BYU Independent Study grade book. \n There are two other ways to complete the played assignments: playing for an evaluator, and sending a video recording to BYU.  The mentor, who can also serve as an evaluator, is paid a fee directly by the student or by the School of Music. Instructions to the student are as follows: \n PLAYING FOR AN EVALUATOR \n  \n A student can complete the played assignments in three separate sessions with a qualified evaluator (and, as a mentor, you may serve as a qualified evaluator).  In choosing a qualified evaluator for played assignments, the student finds an organist with formal training in the fundamentals of classical organ technique.  Formal training means regular and ongoing organ (not piano) lessons or classes with a qualified organ (not piano) teacher.  Even though an organist may have had years of experience playing the organ, without at least several months of serious organ training he or she will not be able to evaluate the student’s playing properly. \n When he or she is ready to pass off a played assignment, the student makes arrangements to play it for the evaluator.  In addition to setting the appointment, it is appropriate to discuss a fee with the evaluator.  If he or she is working with the student on a church service basis, a fee may not be required.  The student should, however, offer to pay the evaluator his or her standard fee. Although fees vary widely, an hourly rate of $30 is often appropriate.  This fee should be paid directly to the evaluator at the conclusion of the session, which usually requires between sixty and ninety minutes.  (Note: Such “paid lessons” are permitted on LDS church premises when there is no reasonable alternative, as long as one of the parties involved is a member of the local church unit.) \n On or before the day of the appointment, the student makes a copy of the appropriate played assignment evaluation form and gives it to the evaluator.  After the assignment is complete, a verbal summary with the student would be appropriate, and the evaluator should then return the form to the student.  Applying this feedback should serve as a valuable guide as the student continues organ study. \n  \n OPTION 1: EVALUATOR SENDS RESULTS TO MENTOR (mentor may serve as both evaluator and mentor). \n A student completes the played assignments in three separate sessions with a qualified evaluator approved by the BYU organ faculty.  First, the student checks the list of approved evaluators.  If he wishes to work with someone whose name does not yet appear on that list, he can propose a qualified evaluator for the played assignments as follows: \n He finds an organist with formal training in the fundamentals of classical organ technique.  Formal training means regular and ongoing organ (not piano) lessons or classes with a qualified organ (not piano) teacher.  Even though an organist may have had years of experience playing the organ, without at least several months of serious organ training he or she will not be able to evaluate the student’s playing properly.  At least two weeks prior to the appointment, he submits to his BYU mentor the name, mailing address, email address, phone number, and a brief description of his proposed evaluator’s organ training, and if approved (by both the mentor and Dr. Cook via email), he or she will be included on an internet list of qualified evaluators. \n When he or she is ready to pass off a played assignment, the student makes arrangements to play it for the evaluator.  In addition to setting the appointment, it is appropriate to discuss a fee with the evaluator.  If he or she is working with the student on a church service basis, a fee may not be required.  The student should, however, offer to pay the evaluator his or her standard fee. Although fees vary widely, an hourly rate of $30 is often appropriate.  This fee should be paid directly to the evaluator at the conclusion of the session, which usually requires between sixty and ninety minutes.  (Note: Such “paid lessons” are permitted on LDS church premises when there is no reasonable alternative, as long as one of the parties involved is a member of the local church unit.) \n On or before the day of the appointment, the student makes a copy of the appropriate played assignment evaluation form and gives it to the evaluator.  After the assignment is complete, a verbal summary with the student would be appropriate.  The evaluator should then return either a copy of the form by mail, or a summary of his or her evaluation by email to the mentor (see address on the evaluation form).  The mentor will review this evaluation and see that the student receives credit on the BYU Independent Study grade book by forwarding an email to Dr. Cook.  Applying this feedback should serve as a valuable guide as the student continues organ study. \n OPTION 2: STUDENT SENDS VIDEO RECORDING DIRECTLY TO MENTOR. \n As an alternative, the student can make a video recording of the played assignment (VHS, VHS-C, MiniDV, DVD) and send it for evaluation by a BYU graduate organ student mentor.  He or she sends the recording, the appropriate Played Assignment Evaluation Form (top section completed) with a check for $20 made out to BYU School of Music and addressed to: \n Played Organ Assignment\nc/o Dr. Don Cook\nC-550 HFAC, BYU\nProvo, UT 84602 \n The student should observe the following in making the video recording: \n The student should receive an evaluation through email within approximately two weeks from the mentor.

MENTORS (certification track only) are paid by the School of Music.\nPLAYED ASSIGNMENTS\nEach course includes three played assignments. Beginning with played assignment 1, students prepare by practicing the organ technique, organ repertoire, hymns, and sight-reading items required for that assignment.  (Note: Speedback lessons 1 and 2 should be completed during this same time.)  This process usually requires several weeks or months.\nThe simplest way to complete the assignments is as follows:  Early in the process, the student makes a copy of the played assignment evaluation forms included with the course instructions and gives them to the teacher.\nThe student’s teacher keeps a record of the requirements as the student completes them during lessons.\nIn the Self Study track, the teacher returns each form to the organist as it is completed, and the mentor is not involved.\nIn the Certification track, after each assignment is complete, the teacher should return a copy of the form by mail, or a summary of his or her evaluation by email to the BYU graduate student mentor.  The mentor will review this evaluation and report to Dr. Don Cook (the BYU organ faculty member) via email.  There is no fee paid to the mentor for this type of evaluation and communication.  Dr. Cook will then post the credit to the BYU Independent Study grade book.\nThere are two other ways to complete the played assignments: playing for an evaluator, and sending a video recording to BYU.  The mentor, who can also serve as an evaluator, is paid a fee directly by the student or by the School of Music. Instructions to the student are as follows:\nPLAYING FOR AN EVALUATOR\n\n\n\nSELF STUDY TRACK\nA student can complete the played assignments in three separate sessions with a qualified evaluator (and, as a mentor, you may serve as a qualified evaluator).  In choosing a qualified evaluator for played assignments, the student finds an organist with formal training in the fundamentals of classical organ technique.  Formal training means regular and ongoing organ (not piano) lessons or classes with a qualified organ (not piano) teacher.  Even though an organist may have had years of experience playing the organ, without at least several months of serious organ training he or she will not be able to evaluate the student’s playing properly.\nWhen he or she is ready to pass off a played assignment, the student makes arrangements to play it for the evaluator.  In addition to setting the appointment, it is appropriate to discuss a fee with the evaluator.  If he or she is working with the student on a church service basis, a fee may not be required.  The student should, however, offer to pay the evaluator his or her standard fee. Although fees vary widely, an hourly rate of $30 is often appropriate.  This fee should be paid directly to the evaluator at the conclusion of the session, which usually requires between sixty and ninety minutes.  (Note: Such “paid lessons” are permitted on LDS church premises when there is no reasonable alternative, as long as one of the parties involved is a member of the local church unit.)\nOn or before the day of the appointment, the student makes a copy of the appropriate played assignment evaluation form and gives it to the evaluator.  After the assignment is complete, a verbal summary with the student would be appropriate, and the evaluator should then return the form to the student.  Applying this feedback should serve as a valuable guide as the student continues organ study.\n\nCERTIFICATION TRACK\nOPTION 1: EVALUATOR SENDS RESULTS TO MENTOR (mentor may serve as both evaluator and mentor).\nA student completes the played assignments in three separate sessions with a qualified evaluator approved by the BYU organ faculty.  First, the student checks the list of approved evaluators.  If he wishes to work with someone whose name does not yet appear on that list, he can propose a qualified evaluator for the played assignments as follows:\nHe finds an organist with formal training in the fundamentals of classical organ technique.  Formal training means regular and ongoing organ (not piano) lessons or classes with a qualified organ (not piano) teacher.  Even though an organist may have had years of experience playing the organ, without at least several months of serious organ training he or she will not be able to evaluate the student’s playing properly.  At least two weeks prior to the appointment, he submits to his BYU mentor the name, mailing address, email address, phone number, and a brief description of his proposed evaluator’s organ training, and if approved (by both the mentor and Dr. Cook via email), he or she will be included on an internet list of qualified evaluators.\nWhen he or she is ready to pass off a played assignment, the student makes arrangements to play it for the evaluator.  In addition to setting the appointment, it is appropriate to discuss a fee with the evaluator.  If he or she is working with the student on a church service basis, a fee may not be required.  The student should, however, offer to pay the evaluator his or her standard fee. Although fees vary widely, an hourly rate of $30 is often appropriate.  This fee should be paid directly to the evaluator at the conclusion of the session, which usually requires between sixty and ninety minutes.  (Note: Such “paid lessons” are permitted on LDS church premises when there is no reasonable alternative, as long as one of the parties involved is a member of the local church unit.)\nOn or before the day of the appointment, the student makes a copy of the appropriate played assignment evaluation form and gives it to the evaluator.  After the assignment is complete, a verbal summary with the student would be appropriate.  The evaluator should then return either a copy of the form by mail, or a summary of his or her evaluation by email to the mentor (see address on the evaluation form).  The mentor will review this evaluation and see that the student receives credit on the BYU Independent Study grade book by forwarding an email to Dr. Cook.  Applying this feedback should serve as a valuable guide as the student continues organ study.\nOPTION 2: STUDENT SENDS VIDEO RECORDING DIRECTLY TO MENTOR.\nAs an alternative, the student can make a video recording of the played assignment (VHS, VHS-C, MiniDV, DVD) and send it for evaluation by a BYU graduate organ student mentor.  He or she sends the recording, the appropriate Played Assignment Evaluation Form (top section completed) with a check for $20 made out to BYU School of Music and addressed to:\nPlayed Organ Assignment\nc/o Dr. Don Cook\nC-550 HFAC, BYU\nProvo, UT 84602\nThe student should observe the following in making the video recording:\n\nInclude a copy of the appropriate played assignment evaluation form with the recording.\nState your name and email address in the recording and on the evaluation form.\nBe sure to follow the directions for each item on the assignment carefully and completely.\nFor manual-only playing, position the camera for a good view of the upper body and hands.\nFor pedal playing, position the camera for a good view of the feet.\nIf you wish to repeat a portion, record over the undesirable “take.”\nThe recording will not be returned.\n\nThe student should receive an evaluation through email within approximately two weeks from the mentor. Applying this feedback should serve as a valuable guide as the student continues organ study. He or she will see that you receive credit on the BYU Independent Study grade book.\n\n\n\nThere is more information on the Organ Study at BYU website (www.organ.byu.edu).

Harmon received a BA in music at BYU and an MA and a PhD at the Eastman School of Music. A widely published composer of organ and choral music, he has performed in Europe, Canada, South America, and the United States. \n All students participating in the program will be traveling together with the directors.

Lauderdale, Florida. Following this, he went abroad to assist with acupuncture research and do further studies in Chinese Herbal Medicine at Beijing University Hospital. Upon returning to the United States he completed a post-graduate acupunture program at the Academy of Five Elements. \n Dr. Weinthal has studied NAET directly under Dr. Devi Nambudripad, founder of NAET. He is certified practitioner of NAET and has advanced training with NAET techniques. Through years of experience with healing, Dr. Weinthal found that just healing the body was “incomplete” and that healing of the spirit was required with many patients. \n Studying with Dr. Robert Jaffe, M.D., D.D. at the Jaffe Institute of Spiritual and Medical Healing, and Sidi Muhammad al Jamal, Shadhiliyya spiritual guide, he became an ordained minister, certified master healer and teacher of the Shadhiliyya Sufi Way. \n Using Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine, NAET, and Spiritual-Medical Healing, Dr. Weinthal provides a unique natural comprehensive treatment to his patients. \n  \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

  "inline_text": "A Guide Through the First Months \n This free course of twelve lessons is designed to help LDS pianists adapt their skills to the organ as soon as possible. Lessons 1-5 and 10-12 are for everyone. But those who must begin very soon to play for church meetings might consider themselves “in shortcut mode” and skip lessons 6-9. These four lessons are for those who can spend the time required to refine their playing “in polish mode” before beginning to serve as an organist. \n All twelve lessons are available free over the Internet as audio lessons (podcasts). There is a total of just over four hours of instruction, with each lesson lasting between five and thirty-five minutes plus pause time. The lessons involve listening to instruction, trying out new skills at the organ, and playing simplified hymns. \n Before taking the audio lessons, you should download and print a free packet of supporting written materials (59 pages, in Adobe pdf format). In addition to the many useful handouts, the packet contains 25 simplified hymns that can be used in those first weeks of service. (Click here for a new handout added to the packet on 2/27/2010.) \n The audio lessons can be taken in several ways: \n \n \n 1. iPod or other mp3 player. Ideally the lessons are taken at the organ console with an iPod or other mp3 player and earphones. To download the lessons without cost, use a computer with a high-speed Internet connection, subscribe to The New LDS Organist audio podcasts on iTunes or Google Podcasts and then download them to your mp3 player. If needed, you can get a free iTunes download. If you prefer, you may purchase an inexpensive mp3 player already loaded with the audio lessons, including earphones and a printed packet ($38 plus $7.50 shipping and taxes). Click here to order, or email questions to mail@ardpublications.com \n 2. Laptop computer. If you do not wish to use an mp3 player, you can take the lessons at the console directly from your laptop computer. Simply subscribe to and get the podcasts on your laptop computer as described above, and then play the lessons at the console through iTunes. \n 3. Desktop computer. Those without mp3 players or with non-portable computers who have high-speed Internet connections can take the lessons away from the console by clicking each lesson here. It is more effective, however, to study most of the lessons at the organ console. \n Those without computers can print the transcript of the lessons (67 pages, in Adobe pdf format) and study them in written form. This will be less effective because of the absence of the many played examples that are included in the audio lessons. \n For a few words of explanation to LDS church leaders, click here. \n These lessons have been used in ward/stake organist training. Click here (and then click the link at the bottom of the page) to see a detailed outline for one five-week introductory organ course. \n The lesson titles are listed below. Click here for a more detailed list of subtopics. \n The New LDS Organist was produced by Dr. Don Cook of the Brigham Young University School of Music, assisted by graduate students Jane Dye, Ruth Eldredge, and Shinji Inagi. \n Copyright © 2007 by Brigham Young University.

  "inline_text": "Dr. Don Cook, Brigham Young University \n (This is not an official document of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) \n One of the great musical misunderstandings in church music is this: if you can play the piano, you can play the organ.  This misconception produces terror in pianists as they approach the organ, and results in organists who lack the confidence to provide musical and spiritual leadership in the service.  There is no substitute for the kind of training that provides confidence in the organist, and that improves the spiritual effectiveness of music in the sacrament meeting. \n Stake and Ward priesthood leadership can arrange training for musicians who are called as organists in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (see Handbook 2: Administering the Church,“Music Training”).  Priesthood leaders usually rely on organists from their own stake or ward to provide this training.  These organists-teachers usually feel a need for outside help in structuring that training. \n I have tried numerous approaches to stake and ward organist training.  Some have proven more successful than others, but all of them have helped me improve my instruction. \n During a graduate organ pedagogy course at BYU Provo in fall semester 2002, Ben Crandall, Emily Spencer, and I decided to take a new approach to developing plans for LDS organist training.  We took as much time as needed to derive a new approach to small group organ training in LDS stakes and wards.  In earlier coursework we had explored sound approaches and methods in teaching, so we started by identifying the outcomes that we wanted, then we used these outcomes as a structure for various types of workshops: single-session, three sessions, six sessions, and an ongoing course.  In all of our discussions, we tried to avoid using the same approaches we had used before simply because we were familiar with them.  We insisted that our desired outcomes dictate our approaches, rather than our approaches determine the outcomes. \n We have discovered that no matter how brief or extended the course of instruction, these outcomes remain valid.  They can serve as the foundation for any course of study from a single 90-minute session to an ongoing course.  For this reason, we are sharing them with you as a means of developing training sessions to fit a variety of situations.  In addition, you are welcome to look over some sample course outlines that we developed using these outcomes. \n Following is a list of desirable outcomes in LDS church organist training.  Click on any one to see an explanation. \n Trained organists have the tools necessary to perform several essential roles in the sacrament meeting: \n Several trained organists are needed in every ward for a variety of reasons: \n Young people who catch the vision of church service as an organist can provide a lifetime of inspired service.  School-aged organists are accustomed to developing skills through regular practice, and consequently seem to learn quickly.  They often respond enthusiastically to opportunities to play in public, and to recognition of their efforts.  They can, simply by example, inspire their peers and even older musicians to study the organ. \n Every spark of interest that a young person shows in learning to play the organ should be matched with enthusiasm from parents and priesthood leaders.  Long-term training should be arranged.  Regular and easy access to the church organ for practice should be provided.  Materials should be purchased.  Patience should be exercised.  Opportunities for service should be provided.  Recognition should be given. \n What is the minimum age for organ training?  Here are a few general considerations: \n While an emphasis on training young people is good, those of any age who wish to receive training should be welcomed with the same enthusiasm. \n Because of its long history, its interesting development, and its vast literature, the organ can easily inspire those engaged in its study a strong determination to do whatever is necessary to learn to play it.  What may begin as a single invitation to play the organ for priesthood meeting may develop into a lifelong commitment to organ study. \n All organ training should be designed to spark that fire.  Time spent during the training session actually playing the organ or operating the devices, listening to live or recorded organ music, visiting actual organs or seeing pictures of beautiful instruments, touching organ pipes, or hearing about great organists may provide just the needed spark. \n Once the spark is ignited, the resulting fire will be self-sustaining if given enough fuel.  Over time, a motivated, well-trained organist can themselves become a trainer.  When that happens, an organ teacher will have reached one of the highest hopes of any trainer, “to teach a teacher how to teach.” \n A trained organist is a valuable commodity in the church.  Even a small amount of intensive organ training places the organist in the class of “the precious few” who have valuable skills that can be shared. \n It is widely known that the best way to learn is to teach.  In every organ course, the teacher should be on the look-out for students who might become the next-generation of trainers.  Once those students are identified, the teacher should talk with them about studying the organ not only with the idea of learning how to play, but learning how to teach.  It is amazing how much more energy a student will expend when they think of themselves as a teacher in training! \n Share your materials with potential trainers.  Even with only minimal training, providing good outlines, class notes, handouts, and resource materials can give students just the confidence they need to offer training on their own. \n Give potential trainers opportunities to help teach organ classes.  They can demonstrate exercises and projects, observe other students play and offer comment, prepare and teach selected topics, and assist in many other ways. \n Outcomes and general guidelines \n Three sessions \n Five sessions

  "inline_text": "Email organ@byu.edu for more information or to schedule a workshop \n Thank you for your interest in LDS organist training through the BYU Organ Department! Here is some information to help you determine what form of assistance might best fit your situation. Although the workshops described below are conducted by BYU, they are endorsed by the leaders of the General Music Committee of the LDS Church. \n FOR MULTIPLE STAKESMulti-Stake Organ Workshops are designed to offer training to pianists interested in learning to play the organ, and to organists at every level of experience. Normally it consists of a single 4- or 5-hour organ workshop together with a recital and hymn-sing, scheduled about six months in advance. The minimum number of attendees required to host one of these events is 60. The workshop is customized to meet the needs of your area, including up to three sessions every hour on topics such as: \n NEW: There is now a special track of classes for youth and young adults! \n The goal: to inspire musicians young and old to better serve the Lord through continued organ training. Because this workshop is a one-time event, it will include a thorough explanation of ways to continue organ training, and a challenge to find the way that best meets individual needs as soon as possible. Instructors will include BYU faculty and graduate student instructor(s), along with well-qualified local organists. No instructor fees are paid by the Stake(s). Expenses are funded through the BYU School of Music “down to the last donut” by a special account underwritten by a generous donor. Arrangements and preparations are coordinated between the official BYU Liaison and a local coordinator from the Host Stake: \n BYU Organ Workshop Administrator provides/arranges: \n Local Workshop Coordinator arranges: (funded by BYU “down to the last donut”) \n Of great importance is the approval and support of the Host Stake leadership. This stake would call a Workshop Coordinator, and together they would invite nearby stakes, as deemed appropriate. For the workshop to be a success, much good publicity and many arrangements will be handled by the coordinator. The official BYU Liaison will work with that person in creating a highly effective workshop. A helpful and detailed checklist for the Workshop Coordinator titled “Hosting a BYU Organ Workshop” will be provided. \n FOR ONE OR TWO STAKESStake Organ Workshops are also available, usually with a local instructor and a BYU instructor. These are smaller in scale than the Multi-Stake Organ Workshops described above, with one or two sessions being taught at a time. However, they can be just as effective in achieving the goal: to inspire musicians young and old to better serve the Lord through continued organ training. \n For local instructors who would like to conduct a Stake Organ Workshopon their own, outlines, lesson plans, handouts, and other resources are available. \n FOR INDIVIDUALSMentored Individual Organ Training is designed to help guide individual organists into the type of training that best meets his/her needs. A BYU mentor is assigned to help devise an effective plan of study. This might include finding a private organ instructor in the area, or identifying one of many tutorials or courses that can assist organists in improving their skills. There is no fee for the services of the mentor. \n Individuals may also explore Organ Training Resources Available through BYU on their own. Particularly effective for pianists who have no organ training is The New LDS Organist, a free set of twelve podcasts and packet to help newly-called organists get started. \n Best wishes in your continued service! \n For questions, comments, or details on bringing an organ workshop to your area, send an email to organ@byu.eduOn Campus Students\n\n\tMusic Majors\n\t\n\t\tDegree Programs\n\t\tCareer and Income Opportunities\n\t\tAdmissions and Scholarship\n\t\tStudents\n\t\n\n\tNon-Music Majors\n\t\n\t\tGroup Organ Study\n\t\tPrivate Organ Study\n\t\tOrgan Registration\n\t\n\n\n \n Music Majors\n\t\n\t\tDegree Programs\n\t\tCareer and Income Opportunities\n\t\tAdmissions and Scholarship\n\t\tStudents\n\t\n \n Degree Programs \n Career and Income Opportunities \n Admissions and Scholarship \n Students \n Non-Music Majors\n\t\n\t\tGroup Organ Study\n\t\tPrivate Organ Study\n\t\tOrgan Registration\n\t\n \n Group Organ Study \n Private Organ Study \n Organ Registration \n Off Campus Students\n\n\tFinding An Organ Teacher\n\tBYU Programs for Off-Campus Organists (Organ Certification)\n\t\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 1-2\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 3-6\n\t\tRepertoire for BYU Independent Study Organ Courses\n\t\n\n\tContinuing Your Organ Training PDF\n\tMaterials Needed For Independent Study Organ Classes PDF\n\tBYU Organ Workshop\n\tOrganTutor\n\tMentor Instructions\n\n \n Finding An Organ Teacher \n BYU Programs for Off-Campus Organists (Organ Certification)\n\t\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 1-2\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 3-6\n\t\tRepertoire for BYU Independent Study Organ Courses\n\t\n \n Independent Study Organ Levels 1-2 \n Independent Study Organ Levels 3-6 \n Repertoire for BYU Independent Study Organ Courses \n Continuing Your Organ Training PDF \n Materials Needed For Independent Study Organ Classes PDF \n BYU Organ Workshop \n OrganTutor \n Mentor Instructions \n Events\n\n\tBYU Organ Workshop\n\tPipe Organ Study Tour of Germany\n\tAGO Events\n\t\n\t\tUtah Valley Chapter AGO\n\t\tSalt Lake City Chapter AGO\n\t\n\n\n \n BYU Organ Workshop \n Pipe Organ Study Tour of Germany \n AGO Events\n\t\n\t\tUtah Valley Chapter AGO\n\t\tSalt Lake City Chapter AGO\n\t\n \n Utah Valley Chapter AGO \n Salt Lake City Chapter AGO \n Ward Organists\n\n\tThe New Ward Organist\n\tWard Organist Training\n\t\n\t\tOrgan Training Outlines\n\t\n\n\tTraveling Organ Workshops\n\tOrgan Training Resources PDF\n\tU of U Group Organ Instruction\n\tUsing OrganTutor PDF\n\tFree Accompaniment PDF\n\n \n The New Ward Organist \n Ward Organist Training\n\t\n\t\tOrgan Training Outlines\n\t\n \n Organ Training Outlines \n Traveling Organ Workshops \n Organ Training Resources PDF \n U of U Group Organ Instruction \n Using OrganTutor PDF \n Free Accompaniment PDF \n Workshops\n\n\tOnline Training Sessions\n\t2021 BYU Organ Workshop\n\tTraveling Organ Workshops\n\n \n Online Training Sessions \n 2021 BYU Organ Workshop \n Traveling Organ Workshops \n Info \u0026 Reference\n\n\tOrgan Training Resources PDF\n\tCarol Dean\n\tContinuing Your Organ Training\n\tDouglas E.

Here is some information to help you determine what form of assistance might best fit your situation. Although the workshops described below are conducted by BYU, they are endorsed by the leaders of the General Music Committee of the LDS Church.FOR MULTIPLE STAKESMulti-Stake Organ Workshops are designed to offer training to pianists interested in learning to play the organ, and to organists at every level of experience. Normally it consists of a single 4- or 5-hour organ workshop together with a recital and hymn-sing, scheduled about six months in advance. The minimum number of attendees required to host one of these events is 60. The workshop is customized to meet the needs of your area, including up to three sessions every hour on topics such as:Introducing the Organ! A Tour of the King of InstrumentsOn the Bench: Things YOU Can Do On the Organ TODAY!Choosing Stops to Fit the OccasionInspiring Hymn PlayingEffective Prelude and PostludeTeaching LDS OrganistsDeveloping Your Pedal TechniqueCoping with Challenging Pedal PartsMaking the Most of Your Practice TimeLearning Organ on Your OwnFree (optional) mini organ lessonsNEW: There is now a special track of classes for youth and young adults!The goal: to inspire musicians young and old to better serve the Lord through continued organ training. Because this workshop is a one-time event, it will include a thorough explanation of ways to continue organ training, and a challenge to find the way that best meets individual needs as soon as possible. Instructors will include BYU faculty and graduate student instructor(s), along with well-qualified local organists. No instructor fees are paid by the Stake(s). Expenses are funded through the BYU School of Music “down to the last donut” by a special account underwritten by a generous donor. Arrangements and preparations are coordinated between the official BYU Liaison and a local coordinator from the Host Stake:BYU Organ Workshop Administrator provides/arranges:Website set-up for registering participantsName tags and folders for attendeesInstructor airfare, meals, and lodgingHandouts for attendeesPublicity flyersHymn Sing/Organ Concert programsLoaner organs (BYU will work with a local organ dealer to get two to three loaner organs)Local Workshop Coordinator arranges: (funded by BYU “down to the last donut”)Meetinghouse reservation and setupPublicityRefreshments after concert (recommended, but optional)Saturday lunchAny bottled water or other refreshmentsOf great importance is the approval and support of the Host Stake leadership. This stake would call a Workshop Coordinator, and together they would invite nearby stakes, as deemed appropriate. For the workshop to be a success, much good publicity and many arrangements will be handled by the coordinator. The official BYU Liaison will work with that person in creating a highly effective workshop. A helpful and detailed checklist for the Workshop Coordinator titled “Hosting a BYU Organ Workshop” will be provided.FOR ONE OR TWO STAKESStake Organ Workshops are also available, usually with a local instructor and a BYU instructor. These are smaller in scale than the Multi-Stake Organ Workshops described above, with one or two sessions being taught at a time. However, they can be just as effective in achieving the goal: to inspire musicians young and old to better serve the Lord through continued organ training.For local instructors who would like to conduct a Stake Organ Workshopon their own, outlines, lesson plans, handouts, and other resources are available.FOR INDIVIDUALSMentored Individual Organ Training is designed to help guide individual organists into the type of training that best meets his/her needs. A BYU mentor is assigned to help devise an effective plan of study. This might include finding a private organ instructor in the area, or identifying one of many tutorials or courses that can assist organists in improving their skills. There is no fee for the services of the mentor.Individuals may also explore Organ Training Resources Available through BYU on their own. Particularly effective for pianists who have no organ training is The New LDS Organist, a free set of twelve podcasts and packet to help newly-called organists get started.FOLLOW UPIf you would like to pursue any of the following with me, please begin by first taking the steps indicated below.Multi-Stake Organ Workshop – gain the approval and support of your stake leadership for this large workshop, and list nearby stakes that would be invited to participate.Stake Organ Workshop – identify any qualified organists in the stake(s) who could assist in conducting the training, and then gain the approval and support of the stake leadership.Mentored Individual Organ Training – first explore Organ Training Resources Available through BYU on your own.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n For most cultures across the globe, there are beauty constants such as clear skin, bright eyes, and shiny hair. Like calmness and strength, these outward features are universally attractive. While we work towards these qualities with regimens that may include exercise, meditation, or even using a nice shampoo, the foods we eat are key to achieving inner and outer beauty. \n In traditional Chinese medicine, foods are prescribed for their effects on organs, blood, yin, yang, and Qi, the major players in our physical and emotional health. Foods such as rice, seaweed, sweet potatoes, and bananas nourish our yin, which in turn hydrates and nourishes organs. Think of a parched plant; after a good watering it becomes more tumescent. Eating yin-enhancing foods nourishes the body in a way that simple drinking water cannot. \n Sweet black rice, when cooked with longan berries (euphoria longana) and Chinese dates, becomes a congee that nourishes blood and Qi. In the Chinese system of food cures, these three foods work together to enhance beauty and longevity. \n Sweet Rice Congee (Taken from Ancient Healing for Modern Women, by Dr. Xiolan Zhao, C.M.D.) \n Ingredients: \n   \n Instructions: \n In a large heavy saucepan, add 6 cups of water, black sweet rice, longan fruit, dates, and raw sugar. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat and simmer for two hours, stirring occasionally. Garnish with ginger. Makes four servings.\nNote: All ingredients are available at most Asian grocery stores. \n  \n Adding nutrient-rich super foods to the diet can give men a healthy boost. \n Here are just a few foods that can help maintain muscle mass, prevent prostate cancer, and more. \n Avocados\nAvocados are a good source of vitamin K, dietary fiber, vitamin B6, vitamin C, folate and copper.  Rich in potassium, avocados contain more of this nutrient than bananas.  Potassium is needed to regulate nerves, heartbeat and, especially, blood pressure.  An added bonus for men: Avocados inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells. \n Blackberries\nBlackberries are packed with Vitamin C, calcium and magnesium, with more than double the amounts than their popular cousin, the blueberry.  Vitamin C is a powerful stress reducer that can lower blood pressure and return cortisol levels to normal faster when taken during periods of stress.  Magnesium and calcium act together to help regulate the nerves and muscle tone. \n Too little magnesium in your diet can cause nerve cells to become over activated and can trigger muscular tension, soreness, spasms, cramps, and fatigue.  Blackberries also score high on the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) scale assesses the antioxidant content of food: the higher the score, the better the food’s ability to neutralize cell-damaging free radicals that lead to cancer. \n Spinach\nSpinach is one of the most nutrient-dense foods in existence.  Spinach can help protect against prostate cancer, reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke, lower blood pressure and strengthen muscles. \n Walnuts\nWhen it comes to their health benefits, walnuts are the king of nuts. Richer in heart-healthy omega-3s than salmon, loaded with more anti-oxidants than red wine, and packing half as much muscle-building protein as chicken, walnuts are one of the all time super foods. \n Yogurt\nEating yogurt that contains live bacterial cultures every day improves digestive health, boosts the immune system, provides protection against cancer and may help you live longer.   Not all yogurts are probiotic though, so make sure the label says “live and active cultures.” \n Let us custom-tailor a treatment plan that will best suit your individual needs so that you can feel better quickly and safely! \n  \n Acupuncture views nutrition in a complex light, through the application of Oriental medicine wisdom to dietary habits. In short, certain foods are considered too yang, or hot to eat in excess during the warmer months, while others are prized for their yin ability to cool the body. Overall, the goal is balance between the internal yin and yang of the body. \n A healthy, nutritional diet, good sleep and moderate exercise can keep your skin and physical form at its best. \n For healthy skin, be sure to integrate these foods into your diet: \n Carrots and Sweet Potatoes: \n Healthy skin is directly dependent on the amount of vitamin A in our diet. Vitamin A acts as an antioxidant to neutralize harmful elements in our skin, helping to prevent wrinkles, resist infection and maintain the skin’s elasticity. Some of the best sources of Vitamin A are vegetables that are deep orange in color. \n Blackberries, Blueberries, Strawberries, and Plums:  \n In a study recently published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, these four fruits weighed in with the highest “total antioxidant capacity” of any food.  The antioxidants and other phytochemicals in these fruits can protect cells from damage and disintegration, thus guarding against premature aging. \n Salmon, Walnuts, Olive Oil, and Flax Seed:  \n Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are responsible for skin repair, moisture content, and overall elasticity, but because the body cannot produce its own EFAs, they must be obtained through the diet. Fish, walnuts, and flax seed oil are among the best sources for omega 3 fatty acids. Eating good-quality olive oil helps keep skin lubricated and keeps it looking and feeling healthier overall. Which olive oils are the best for your skin? Those labeled “cold pressed,” “expeller processed,” or “extra virgin” are the least processed forms. As a result, they contain the highest levels of antioxidant substances. \n Whole Wheat Bread, Brown Rice, Turkey, Tuna and Brazil Nuts:  \n Selenium is an antioxidant mineral responsible for tissue elasticity and healthy skin. It may also play an important role in preventing skin cancer, as some recent studies are showing that skin damaged by the sun may suffer fewer consequences if selenium levels are high. \n Green Tea:  \n Green tea’s ability to slow down the development of some signs of aging is attributed to its high levels of polyphenols, which have been well-documented for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Green tea may help prevent or reduce the risk of skin cancer according to a study published recently in the Archives of Dermatology, which shows that whether taken orally or applied to the skin, green tea can reduce the risk of damage from ultraviolet light and thus reduce the risk of skin cancer. \n Water : \n  Hydration plays a key role in keeping skin cells healthy. It is essential to maintaining your skin’s elasticity and suppleness. Keeping cells hydrated helps cells move nutrients in and toxins out, which helps keep skin clean and clear. \n Let us help you to optimize your skin health! \n Acupuncture and Oriental medicine can be very effective at treating skin conditions. Treatments can provide quick relief for acute symptoms and significant and lasting relief from recurrent or chronic skin conditions. \n The skin reflects and reacts to imbalances within the body’s internal landscape and the effects of the environment. Internal disharmonies caused by strong emotions, diet, and your constitution, as well as environmental influences such as wind, dryness, dampness, and heat, can all contribute to the development of a skin disorder. To keep your skin healthy and beautiful on the outside, you must work on the inside of your body as well. Increasing the flow of energy, blood and lymph circulation improves the skin’s natural healthy color. \n Promotion of collagen production increases muscle tone and elasticity, helping to firm the skin. Stimulating the formation of body fluids nourishes the skin and encourages it to be moister, softer, smoother and more lustrous. \n General skin conditions that can be treated with acupuncture and Oriental medicine include acne, dermatitis, eczema, pruritus, psoriasis, rosacea, shingles and urticaria (hives). Oriental medicine does not recognize skin problems as one particular syndrome. Instead, it aims to treat the specific symptoms that are unique to each individual using a variety of techniques with acupuncture, such as herbal medicine, bodywork, lifestyle/dietary recommendations and energetic exercises to restore imbalances found in the body. Therefore, if 10 patients are treated with Oriental medicine for eczema, each patient will receive a unique, customized treatment with different lifestyle and dietary recommendations. \n If you suffer from a skin condition or would like to know how to optimize your skin health, Contact One Essence Healing to learn more about how acupuncture and Oriental medicine can help you. \n More than 95 million Americans suffer from digestive disorders ranging from constipation, diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome to more serious conditions such as acid reflux (GERD), ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. In fact, more than 35 million physician office visits a year are due to gastrointestinal complaints. Reports are confirming that acupuncture and Oriental medicine can offer relief from even the most complex digestive problems. \n Evidence that Oriental medicine has been used for digestive disorders can be found in early medical literature dating back to 3 AD, where specific acupuncture points and herbal formulas for borborygmus (rumbling or gurgling in the intestines), abdominal pain and diarrhea with pain are discussed. \n According to Oriental medical theory, most digestive disorders are due to disharmony in the spleen and stomach. The spleen plays a central part in the health and vitality of the body, taking a lead role in the assimilation of nutrients and maintenance of physical strength. It turns digested food from the stomach into usable nutrients and qi (energy). Many schools of thought have been formed around this organ; the premise being that the proper functioning of the”‘middle” is the key to all aspects of vitality. \n By taking into account a person’s constitution and varied symptoms, a treatment plan is designed specifically for the individual to bring their “middle” back into harmony and optimize the proper functioning of the digestive system.

One of the most well-known types of repetitive stress injury, carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) accounts for over two million visits to physicians’ offices and approximately 465,000 carpal tunnel release operations each year, making it the most frequent surgery of the hand and wrist. \n Symptoms of repetitive stress injuries include tightness, stiffness, pain, tingling, numbness, coldness and loss of strength in the arm. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a repetitive stress injury that refers specifically to the inflammation of a specific ligament that puts pressure on the median nerve. \n Acupuncture is extremely effective for treating repetitive stress injuries including carpal tunnel syndrome; eliminating the need for surgery or the use of anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids. In fact, one of the most common reasons that people get acupuncture is for repetitive stress injuries. Recent studies even suggest that acupuncture may be more effective than corticosteroids when it comes to treating CTS. \n The carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway in the wrist made up of ligaments and bones. The median nerve and the tendons that connect the fingers to the muscles of the forearm pass through this tightly spaced tunnel. \n Carpal tunnel syndrome, also known as median nerve entrapment, occurs when swelling or irritation of the tendons in the carpal tunnel results in pressure on the median nerve causing pain in the palm side of the wrist and pain and tingling in the fingers. The median nerve controls sensations to the palm side of the thumb and fingers, as well as impulses to some small muscles in the hand that allow the fingers and thumb to move. \n Symptoms usually start gradually, with frequent burning, tingling, or numbness in the palm of the hand and the fingers, especially the index, middle and ring fingers. Pain can sometimes travel up the arm and affect the shoulder. The symptoms often first appear during the night. As symptoms worsen, people might feel pain, weakness, or numbness in the hand and wrist, radiating up the arm during the day. Decreased grip strength may make it difficult to form a fist, grasp small objects, or perform other manual tasks. If not properly treated, CTS can cause irreversible nerve damage and permanent deterioration of muscle tissue. \n From an Oriental medicine perspective, a repetitive stress injury is seen as a disruption of the flow of Qi and Blood (Xue) within the area and associated with cold, dampness or wind penetrating the muscles and sinews. Acupuncture points, stretching exercises, herbal remedies and nutritional supplements are chosen to treat accordingly. \n In addition to reducing the swelling, inflammation and pain, acupuncture addresses any headaches, neck pain, shoulder stiffness and sleeping problems that often accompany this condition. Your treatment may also take into account any underlying conditions that contribute to the development of RSI including posture, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid problems, diabetes, and hormonal changes of pregnancy and menopause. \n Managing repetitive stress injuries often requires some lifestyle changes, and it can take time to work out a strategy that works best for you. \n Here are a few minor changes you can implement to minimize stress on your hands and wrists: \n Shoulders and neck should be relaxed to open the chest and allow your head to float upwards without strain. When using a keyboard, wrists should be in a relaxed middle position and in a straight line with your forearms at elbow height or slightly lower.\nIf you or someone you know suffers from a repetitive stress injury, Call us today to learn more about how acupuncture and Oriental medicine can help you. \n Our society puts a premium on our waking hours and has the tendency to underestimate the importance of a full-night’s sleep. Often, good sleep hygiene is an afterthought for many people. Millions of people are besieged with insomnia and look for quick fixes instead of exploring the root causes of the problem. \n Evening is a time to allow our minds and bodies to turn inward to our subconscious. Excessive lighting at night, evening shift work, evening computing, video games, television and late-night eating all serve to counteract the body’s natural rhythms. It’s no wonder people have trouble sleeping. Exposure to early morning light and dusk helps to regulate sleep hormones in the body. Rather than embrace nighttime we tend to let our minds wander from one element of stress to another keeping us up for hours or perhaps an entire evening. We are then forced to approach the new day without having benefited from the regenerative powers that night time brings. \n In Oriental medicine sleep occurs when the yang energy of the day folds into Yin – nighttime. Yin energy of the body is cooling and restorative. It is the time of day when our bodies turn inward and regenerate. This is the time we dream and explore the caverns of our unconscious mind. Conversely, daytime is yang, which is expansive. We expend the energy we have built up from the process of sleeping. Together, this is the cycle of yin and yang. \n To apply the concept of yin and yang to your everyday life try eating your last meal at least three hours before going to bed. If you are a hot excess type, you can cool your body down by avoiding hot and spicy food and drink. Avoid alcohol, coffee, chocolate any other stimulants, especially late in the day. \n Help circulate your body’s energy by working out or by gentle exercising. Build your body’s nutritive aspect by eating marrow based soups and stews, dark pigmented vegetables and fruits. Avoid overworking or over rumination as well. \n Meditation is an invaluable tool to help your brain unwind. Helping the body create a sense of calm meditation can reduce stress, increase feelings of well-being, and improve overall health. It is of specific use to help one increase alertness, relaxation and reflection even in “waking” states. Meditation is best practiced during the day to help ease your sleep patterns at night. \n One contributor to insomnia, stress, weakens the function of the liver, which in turn affects the health of your nerves. Acupuncture and Oriental medicine have a calming effect on the nervous system clearing obstructions in the muscle and nerve channels, assisting the flow of oxygen-enriched energy and relaxing the system. Common noted benefits include deeper breathing, improved digestive abilities, better sleeping patterns, and a general sense of well being. \n Practicing good sleep hygiene and keeping your body in sync with the rhythm of day and night can help your body cope with sleep deprivation give it an opportunity to get stronger and heal. \n By implementing just a few of the following suggestions you should notice a great improvement in your sleep and how you function in the daylight hours. \n   \n Patients suffering TMJ (temporomandibular joint disorder) can find relief from acupuncture.  Research conducted at the Ribeirão Preto Dental School, São Paulo University in Brazil, found that after 3 months of acupuncture, patients with TMJ experienced significantly less pain, increased strength of their bite and decreased EMG activity of the masticatory muscles. \n Temporomandibular joint and muscle disorders (TMJ disorders) are problems or symptoms of the chewing muscles and joints that connect your lower jaw to your skull.  17 patients were studied using acupuncture points for TMJ.  EMG measures were acquired before and after the treatment. The data collected at rest, protrusion, left and right laterality, and clenching were normalized by maximum voluntary contraction. Maximal bite force in right and left molar regions were also measured. \n The researchers found decreased EMG activity at rest, protrusion, left and right laterality, and clenching; as well as increased values of maximal bite force after acupuncture treatment. \n The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine, 15 Issue 12: December 15, 2009 \n By: International Anesthesia Research Society (IARS) \n The scientific validity of traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of pain received a nod of support in the May issue of Anesthesia \u0026 Analgesia, official journal of the International Anesthesia Research Society (IARS). \n Dr. Philip Lang and colleagues of the University of Munich used quantitative sensory testing to identify changes in pain sensitivity with acupuncture in 24 healthy volunteers. After applying acupuncture to the leg, the researchers found that pain thresholds increased by up to 50 percent. Effects were noted in both the treated leg and the untreated (contralateral) leg. \n Quantitative sensory testing is used clinically to help physicians understand specific injuries in nerve fibers associated with chronic pain. It includes tests of both thermal perception (heat and cold), and mechanical perception (pressure applied to the skin). The patterns of response provide diagnostic information in patients with nerve injury regarding the type of nerve involved, and possible treatments. \n The results pointed to two nerve fibers—the “A delta” pain fibers and the “C” pain fibers—as being specifically affected by acupuncture. Although the effects were modest, the researchers believe they provide the basis for future studies in individuals with chronic pain, where the effects might be more dramatic. \n The study also supported the effects of three different forms of acupuncture: manual acupuncture needling alone and with the addition of high-frequency and low-frequency electrical stimulation. All treatments were performed by an experienced acupuncturist, applied to acupuncture points commonly used in pain management. \n The results provide a scientific background for the ancient practice of acupuncture, according to Dr. Dominik Irnich, Head of the Multidisciplinary Pain Centre, Department of Anesthesiology, University of Munich, and the study’s leading author. Additionally, Dr. Irnich notes, “Our results show that contralateral stimulation leads to a remarkable pain relief. This suggests that acupuncturists should needle contralaterally if the affected side is too painful or not accessible—for example, if the skin is injured or there is a dressing in place.” \n Dr. Steven L. Shafer, Editor-in-Chief of Anesthesia \u0026 Analgesia and Professor of Anesthesiology at Columbia University, views the results as an important preliminary finding. “Reproducible findings are the cornerstone of scientific inquiry,” Dr. Shafer comments. “The authors have clearly described their methodology, and their findings. If other laboratories can reproduce these results in properly controlled studies, then this provides further support for the scientific basis of acupuncture. Additionally, the ability of quantitative sensory testing to identify specific types of nerves involved in pain transmission may help direct research into the mechanism of acupuncture analgesia.” \n More than 45 million Americans (one in six) suffer from chronic headaches, 20 million of whom are women. Scientific research shows that acupuncture can be more effective than medication in reducing the severity and frequency of chronic headaches. \n The pain that headache and migraine sufferers endure can impact every aspect of their lives.  A widely accepted form of treatment for headaches, acupuncture can offer powerful relief without the side effects that prescription and over-the-counter drugs can cause. \n Headaches and migraines, as well as their underlying causes have been treated successfully with acupuncture and Oriental medicine for thousands of years.  Acupuncture and Oriental medicine can be used alone in the management and treatment of headaches, or as part of a comprehensive treatment program. \n Oriental Medicine does not recognize migraines and chronic headaches as one particular syndrome. Instead, it aims to treat the specific symptoms that are unique to each individual using a variety of of techniques such as acupuncture, tui-na massage, and energetic exercises to restore imbalances found in the body. Therefore, your diagnosis and treatment will depend on a number of variables including: \n Your answers to these questions will help your practitioner create a treatment plan specifically for you. The basic foundation for Oriental medicine is that there is a life energy flowing through the body which is termed Qi (pronounced chee). This energy flows through the body on channels known as meridians that connect all of our major organs.  According to Oriental medical theory, illness or pain arises when the cyclical flow of Qi in the meridians becomes unbalanced. Acupuncture stimulates specific points located on or near the surface of the skin to alter various biochemical and physiological conditions that cause aches and pains or illness. \n The length, number and frequency of treatments will vary. Typical treatments last from five to 30 minutes, with the patient being treated one or two times a week. Some headaches, migraines and related symptoms are relieved after the first treatment, while more severe or chronic ailments often require multiple treatments. \n Since the early seventies, studies around the globe have suggested that acupuncture is an effective treatment for migraines and headaches.  Researchers at Duke University Medical Center analyzed the results of more than 30 studies on acupuncture as a pain reliever for a variety of ailments, including chronic headaches. They found that acupuncture decreases pain with fewer side effects and can be less expensive than medication.  Researchers found that using acupuncture as an alternative for pain relief also reduced the need for post-operative pain medications. \n In a study published in the November 1999 issue of Cephalalgia, scientists evaluated the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of migraines and recurrent headaches by systematically reviewing 22 randomized controlled trials. A total of 1,042 patients were examined. It was found that headache and migraine sufferers experienced significantly more relief from acupuncture than patients who were administered “sham” acupuncture. \n A clinical observation, published in a 2002 edition of the Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine, studied 50 patients presenting with various types of headaches who were treated with scalp acupuncture. The results of this study showed that 98 percent of patients treated with scalp acupuncture experienced no headaches or only occasional, mild headaches in the six months following care. \n In a case study, published in the June 2003 Issue of Medical Acupuncture, doctors found that acupuncture resulted in the resolution or reduction in the frequency and severity of cluster headaches, and a decrease or discontinuation of pain medications. It was concluded that acupuncture can be used to provide sustained relief from cluster headaches and to stimulate the body’s natural production of adrenal cortisol to aid in discontinuing corticosteroids. \n According to the July 2005 issue of the British Medical Journal, a randomized controlled trial in Germany found that acupuncture cut tension headache rates almost in half.  Researchers divided 270 patients who reported similarly severe tension headaches into three groups for the study. Over the project’s eight-week period, one group received traditional acupuncture, one received only minimal acupuncture, and the third group received neither treatment. Those receiving the traditional acupuncture reported headache rates of nearly half that of those who received no treatments, suffering 7 fewer days of headaches. The minimal acupuncture group suffered 6.6 fewer days, and the non-acupuncture group suffered 1.5 fewer days.  The improvements continued for months after the treatments were concluded, rising slightly as time went on. \n Do you or someone you know suffer from headaches or migraines? \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

From a Western perspective, we know that longans contain large amounts of Vitamin C and phenolic compounds, which may help to detoxify and protect the liver. \n Alternate Tasks – Avoid doing the same task for more than a couple of hours at a time and alternate between tasks that use different muscle groups where possible. Fatigue is a sign that you need to take a break. Take small breaks to gently stretch and bend your hands and wrists and readjust your position. \n Reduce Pressure – Many people use more force than needed to perform tasks involving their hands, which can increase pressure and cause irritation. Be mindful of the speed and amount of pressure used to perform tasks. Ease up, slow down, and grip using your palm or whole hand to distribute the load. If using tools such as riveters or jackhammers for extended periods, take frequent breaks or operate the tool at a speed that causes the least amount of vibration. \n Cultivate Good Posture – Incorrect posture can cause your shoulders to roll forward, shortening neck and shoulder muscles and compressing nerves in your neck, which can affect your wrists, hands, and fingers. \n Maintain a routine sleep schedule. \n Make your bedroom a sanctuary. \n Keep it dark, cool, and quiet. \n Establish a sense of safety with your surroundings. \n Reduce nicotine, caffeine and alcohol use. \n Avoid rigorous exercise 3-5 hours prior to bedtime. \n Avoid heavy meals near bedtime. \n Position clock away from the bed. \n Limit television and computer use to early evening. \n Is the headache behind your eyes and temples, or is it located more on the top of your head? \n When do your headaches occur (i.e. night, morning, after eating)? \n Do you find that a cold compress or a darkened room can alleviate some of the pain? \n Is the pain dull and throbbing, or sharp and piercing?",

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n I practice a holistic approach to health and wellness, which means that I look at how all areas of your life are connected. Does stress at your job or in your relationship cause you to overeat? Does lack of sleep or low energy prevent you from exercising? As we work together, we will look at how all parts of your life affect your health as a whole. \n My approach is not to dwell on calories, carbs, fats, and proteins. It is not to create lists of restrictions or good and bad foods. Instead, I work with my clients to create a happy, healthy life in a way that is flexible, fun and rewarding. \n Together we’ll work to reach your health goals in areas such as achieving optimal weight, reducing food cravings, increasing sleep, and maximizing energy. As we work together, you’ll develop a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you and implement lasting changes that will improve your energy, balance and health. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Acupuncture, or “needle therapy” (zhenjiu) as it is called in Chinese, is an ancient form of medicine which is gaining more and more popularity in this country for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. \n During a treatment, very thin, solid, hairlike needles are inserted at specific points on the body. In Chinese these points are called “neural nodes” (jie) and the stimulation of these nodes affects both the central and peripheral nervous systems. It triggers the release of the body’s internal chemicals such as endorphins and enkephalins, which have pain-relieving properties. If you have pain that is lingering or is not being treated by other modalities, then acupuncture offers a time-tested, very reliable method of pain relief. \n During a treatment, very thin, solid, hairlike needles are inserted at specific points on the body.

From there, we can give you an estimate of the cost of the first series of treatments in our office and what results you can expect in that time frame. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n “Offering emotional freedom from stress, anxiety, panic depression, anger,trauma,PTSD, abuse, addictions,chronic pain, relationship issues and more.” \n Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) is a highly effective self-help tool used in my coaching. It was first developed by Dr. Roger Callahan at Stanford University in the 1980s but it’s roots go back 3000 years to ancient Chinese medicine. It has been proven effective in enhancing the ability to change behavior patterns, overcome negative beliefs, and eliminate stress. Finger tapping on the face and upper body’s acupressure points in a consistent manner while thinking about a past painful events dissipates the related negative emotions. The resulting feelings of calm and release are in actuality altering brain function (as seen on digital brain scans during treatment). EFT is akin to acupressure for the emotions. It is said that 1 hour of EFT is equivalent to 100 hours of traditional talk therapy. \n EFT is gaining mass acceptance as research becomes widely published. The EFT instructional manual has been translated in over 20 languages and has been downloaded by over 1 million people around the world. Although relatively unknown amongst traditional allopathic practitioners in the United States, EFT is being used routinely in children’s cancer hospital wards in Mexico as well as by the Israeli military for treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. Several Phoenix area professional sports teams contract EFT practitioners for peak performance training. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

  "inline_text": "Classes are designed for organists at a range of levels or on certain levels of training. Participants should place themselves into one of the levels listed at the beginning of the Class Descriptions. Beginning organists are encouraged to attend those classes marked with an asterisk (*) on the Daily Schedule. If you are unsure of your level, please read carefully the What to Bring instructions. \n One 50-minute virtual private lesson ($60) with a workshop instructor is available during the workshop week. Registration, scheduling, and payment for private lessons will become available on Monday June 21st on our private lessons page. These lessons are only available to those 18 years of age and above. \n The BYU Organ Workshop is geared towards adults 18 and over. We recommend that younger organists register for the Young Musicians’ SummerFestival and Institute. This is a program for instrumentalists and vocalists ages 14–18. Participants are able to be with their own age group and enjoy top-notch musical instruction (including on the organ—small-group instruction), along with evening social events with their peers. \n BYU Independent Study offers six levels of courses (MUSIC 399R, sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (credit); and Music 71-76 (noncredit) designed to provide motivation for organists to improve their skills by working toward specific goals. The courses emphasize the following skills: organ technique, organ literature, hymn playing, registration, music theory, sight-reading, transposition, and choir accompaniment. \n After choosing your level, you have up to one year from the time of enrollment to pass the assignments and exams. You will progress through the course requirements with the help of a qualified organ instructor (finding the instructor and paying the instructor’s fees are your responsibilities). Upon passing one level, you may enroll for the next level. The cost for the credit courses is $398-$995, and for the non-credit courses is $150. Music 71 and 72 are also offered as free courses. \n Assignments are graded either by the BYU instructor assigned to your course or by computer. The exams are of two types: (1) written exams on theory, registration, etc., and (2) played assignments with a member of the BYU organ faculty, or with an approved evaluator. Helpful feedback is provided for all assignments and exams. \n E-mail organ@byu.edu to request a letter to be sent to you or directly to your school district. \n We are always happy to receive input for improvement. We read every submission and will implement those ideas that would improve the workshop and are feasible. You can email organ@byu.edu with your comments. Also, an online evaluation will be emailed to you for your feedback following the workshop. \n Please email your request to organ@byu.edu. Make sure you state your name and what options you were registered for. After the deadline, each situation will be considered individually, depending on the case and the reason for the refund request. \n Because the BYU Organ Workshop is well attended and there are other conferences and workshops happening at the same time, the BYU Traffic Office will not be granting permits to park directly adjacent to the Harris Fine Arts Center. Additionally, summer term at BYU is still in session, employees are still working, and parking in central campus is limited. Parking for the 2019 program is in Lots 2A and 2V, near the Museum of Art (MOA). Free parking is also available in Lot 20, west of the BYU Conference Center. It takes approximately 10 minutes to walk from the Conference Center parking lot to the Harris Fine Arts Center. For the evening events you may park in Lot 2 east of the Museum of Art. \n During Supervised Practice, you may practice on any of the 12 digital organs in the organ lab. This is an excellent time for hands-on training. You might also consider bringing a copy of the stoplist of your organ to Supervised Practice and Study to get a few registration tips from the instructor. Four of the organs are reserved for these ten-minute supervised practice sessions. The other eight organs are open for practice or online study without supervision on a first-come, first-served basis. There is no extra cost for this. \n Private Organ Instruction sessions are one-on-one organ lessons with your choice of both instructor and organ—an excellent opportunity to receive help in hymn playing, organ pieces, BYU Independent Study organ course requirements, or any area of organ performance. Play hymns and/or organ repertoire that you have prepared for the instructor, who will comment on your preparation and provide guidance for further study. You must preregister for this. There are 50-minute appointments ($60) available with the instructor on the instrument of your choice (space limited). Limited practice time at no charge and choice of instruments are available throughout the workshop. \n Many classes are hands-on and require full attention. Infants and young children will not be admitted to any workshop sessions. \n A list of eating areas will be included in the packet you receive at check-in (Monday, noon until 5:00 p.m. and Tuesday from 8:00 a.m. on). There are also vending machines and a microwave in the basement of the Harris Fine Arts Center. \n We plan on having a display room with items that can be purchased during the workshop. Many of the offerings are items that are commonly needed in the Independent Study Organ Courses and during the workshop. Day Murray Music stocks most of the titles needed during the BYU Organ Workshop. They are prepared to fill orders quickly, charging actual shipping and no handling charges. Those in the Murray or Lehi, Utah areas are welcome to visit their stores to shop in person. \n You will be notified when sign-ups for scheduled practice (no charge) becomes available. \n To make the most of some classes, try to arrange to be near an organ. Having access to a church organ, a home organ, or even a keyboard or piano during those classes will help you internalize what is being taught. Home\n\n\tHome\n\n \n Home \n About\n\n\tAbout\n\tTestimonials\n\n \n About \n Testimonials \n Registration\n\n\tRegistration Info\n\tRegister Now!\n\tPrivate Lessons\n\tScholarships\n\n \n Registration Info \n Register Now! \n Private Lessons \n Scholarships \n Program\n\n\tDaily Schedule\n\tConcerts \u0026 Activities\n\tEarly-Bird Options\n\n \n Daily Schedule \n Concerts \u0026 Activities \n Early-Bird Options \n Resources\n\n\tWhat to Bring (Online)\n\tWhat to Bring (In-Person)\n\tSix Organ Instruction Levels\n\tFrequently Asked Questions\n\tLinks\n\n \n What to Bring (Online) \n What to Bring (In-Person) \n Six Organ Instruction Levels \n Frequently Asked Questions \n Links \n Log In \n Home\n\n\tHome\n\n \n Home \n About\n\n\tAbout\n\tTestimonials\n\n \n About \n Testimonials \n Registration\n\n\tRegistration Info\n\tRegister Now!\n\tPrivate Lessons\n\tScholarships\n\n \n Registration Info \n Register Now! \n Private Lessons \n Scholarships \n Program\n\n\tDaily Schedule\n\tConcerts \u0026 Activities\n\tEarly-Bird Options\n\n \n Daily Schedule \n Concerts \u0026 Activities \n Early-Bird Options \n Resources\n\n\tWhat to Bring (Online)\n\tWhat to Bring (In-Person)\n\tSix Organ Instruction Levels\n\tFrequently Asked Questions\n\tLinks\n\n \n What to Bring (Online) \n What to Bring (In-Person) \n Six Organ Instruction Levels \n Frequently Asked Questions \n Links \n Log In \n Bring an LDS hymnbook or your cell phone or tablet with the hymnbook app for the Hymn Sing and for classes. \n Review the class descriptions carefully before arriving so you know what other items to bring. \n Bring a notebook to capture all of the good information and take notes shared by the teachers.

Additionally, summer term at BYU is still in session, employees are still working, and parking in central campus is limited. Parking for the 2019 program is in Lots 2A and 2V, near the Museum of Art (MOA). Free parking is also available in Lot 20, west of the BYU Conference Center. It takes approximately 10 minutes to walk from the Conference Center parking lot to the Harris Fine Arts Center. For the evening events you may park in Lot 2 east of the Museum of Art.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHow is Supervised Practice different from Private Organ Instruction? \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDuring Supervised Practice, you may practice on any of the 12 digital organs in the organ lab. This is an excellent time for hands-on training. You might also consider bringing a copy of the stoplist of your organ to Supervised Practice and Study to get a few registration tips from the instructor. Four of the organs are reserved for these ten-minute supervised practice sessions. The other eight organs are open for practice or online study without supervision on a first-come, first-served basis. There is no extra cost for this.Private Organ Instruction sessions are one-on-one organ lessons with your choice of both instructor and organ—an excellent opportunity to receive help in hymn playing, organ pieces, BYU Independent Study organ course requirements, or any area of organ performance. Play hymns and/or organ repertoire that you have prepared for the instructor, who will comment on your preparation and provide guidance for further study. You must preregister for this. There are 50-minute appointments ($60) available with the instructor on the instrument of your choice (space limited). Limited practice time at no charge and choice of instruments are available throughout the workshop.\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCan I bring my infant or child?

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n www.naet.com \n NAET was created in the 1980s by Dr. Devi Nambudripad. She suffered with many food, environmental and chemical allergies her whole life. She was so ill in her 20s that she could only eat broccoli and rice. At the time she was studying Chinese medicine in graduate school and had come home one day after receiving an acupuncture treatment. As she was cooking her rice, she decided to try a bite of a carrot, and immediately passed out on the kitchen floor. Coming to, she felt fantastic! She discovered that if you combine acupuncture stimulation (or acupressure without needles) with exposure to a specific allergen after a period of avoidance, you can eliminate that allergy! The actual technique has of course been refined since then. \n How it works is you hold a specific allergen in your hand and we use muscle response testing to determine if your body has a weakness, or allergy, to that item. If you do, we treat it. The treatment consists of gentle palpation down your spine as you hold onto the allergen. We re-test the item then and it should be “strong.” In other words, we stimulate your nervous system – kind of like re-booting a computer – to change its response to the allergen. Instead of your body having an allergic, or “fight-or-flight” reaction to the substance, your body can have a “normal” response. \n We have found NAET to be beneficial in treating pollen allergies, anaphylactic allergies, and mild food allergies. \n NAET stands for Nambudripad’s Allergy Elimination Technique, developed by Dr. Devi S. Nambudripad, a pioneer of this practice. NAET is a combination of methods that uses most of what is already known from allopathic medical knowledge, chiropractic, kinesiology, acupuncture and nutrition. NAET is a non-invasive, drug free, natural solution that eliminates allergies of all types. It helps shift mental, emotional and physical imbalances. \n From a holistic perspective, based on Oriental medical principles, allergy is a condition of unusual sensitivity of a person to one or more substances that may be harmless to the majority of individuals. In the allergic person, the allergic substance is viewed by the brain as a threat to the body’s well being. Allergies are the result of energy imbalances in the body, leading to a diminished state of health in one or more organ systems. \n According to the NAET perspective, allergies include:\n \n The allergy test is done by way of muscle testing (kinesiology). An energy vial of the substance is placed in your hand while you are muscle tested. A weak reaction will indicate that this substance needs to be treated through Acupressure and Acupuncture. On following appointment, the first allergen will be retested and strengthened if necessary. Afterwards the next item on the NAET Basic protocol is checked and, if found weak, it will be treated. NAET Protocol will be strictly followed. The purpose of this process is to improve a person’s immune system. There are 15 to 20 items in the basic protocol that can be tested. \n By clearing foods from the basic protocol, we strengthen the immune system, improve digestion and absorption. This allows the body to get the necessary nutrients, which are essential for life. \n Anyone who suffers from allergies can benefit from NAET Treatment at any age no matter how long they have suffered from allergy symptoms. \n One allergen is cleared per visit. Each individual has a different genetic makeup and health history so the number of sessions required varies from one individual to another. For some people allergens are cleared immediately, however, for others it may take many sessions to accomplish the desired results. \n Can Allergies cause real illness? \n Allergies can definitely cause illness. Continuous contact with an allergen produces toxins in the body, and causes blockages in the meridians. If these blockages are not cleared, reactions to the allergens often produce symptoms that mimic other diseases. \n How do I know if NAET is right for me? \n To know more about NAET and how it helps to remove allergies, we suggest that you read the book entitled, “Say Goodbye to Illness” by Dr. Devi Nambudripad. You may order the book from our office or from any bookstore. After reading it, you can decide if you think it is appropriate for you. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you. Together we implement lasting changes that will improve your energy, balance and health.

  "inline_text": "Dale E. Monson\nDirector, BYU School of Music\nAugust 8, 2006 \n That moment was a capsule reflection of a question I have carried with me through many years. If such simple assumptions like “high” and “low” didn’t seem to have much universal meaning (at least for her, since she intuitively chose “little” and “big” instead), what does music really mean? \n Years earlier I had been flailing away with a baton in the apartment of Maestro Joseph Rosenstock, when I was studying orchestral conducting. He sat at the piano, reducing the full orchestral score of Beethoven symphonies and playing them at the keyboard (something I’m sure all of you can do), while I conducted from behind my music stand. In the middle of some movement or other he suddenly stopped playing, looked a little disgusted, and told me to go sit on the couch. He came over, opened his score, shoved it under my nose and said, “You have to read the score like a book!” I had no idea what he was talking about. How do you read a score \n like a book? It’s a musical score, not a book! He means me to see some sort of meaning in this score that I can’t find. What does this music mean—for me, for others? \n Growing up I tried to immerse myself in music in every way possible, because its meaning seemed magic to me. When it first came out, I sat through The Music Man seven times in two days (back in the days when theaters didn’t kick you out between shows). As I grew older, I tried everything that had anything to do with music. I played clarinet from the second grade on, joining bands, orchestras, chamber groups, and playing in festivals and solo competitions. I spent hours at the piano, picking out tunes and chords by ear. I studied a little violin—even buying a violin at the end of my mission to carry home. I bought a 12-string Gibson guitar and a banjo, becoming a groupie to a guy I worked with who had grown up in the Ozarks, a great bluegrass player of “old-time” music, and we’d sit in his living room with the tape recorder going until 1 or 2 a.m. I spent hours locked away with BYU’s music synthesizer, weaving patch chords together and trying to make interesting sounds. I worked as a music copyist and played a Fender Rhodes keyboard in a soft rock band in college to pay the bills. I didn’t have a large record collection—I couldn’t afford it—but the few records I had were worn through to the other side: Stravinsky, Sibelius, Mozart. \n When I enrolled in college I took philosophy courses, read books on aesthetics, and studied acoustics and physiology, trying to answer my question, “What does music mean?” I agreed with Aristotle, “”Rhythms and melodies contain representations of anger and mildness, and also of courage and temperance and all their opposites and other moral qualities, that most closely correspond to the true natures of these qualities…. Music has the power of producing a certain effect on the moral character of the soul.” When I considered my musical art and religion I had some of the fears shared by St. Augustine: “”Thus I float between peril of pleasure, and an \n approved profitable custom: inclined the more to allow the old usage of singing in the Church, and yet again, so often as it befalls me to be more moved with the voice than with the message, I confess myself to have grievously offended: at which time I wish rather not to have heard the music. See now in what a state I am!” I read Hermann Hesse’s Glasperlenspiel (The Glass Bead Game) and wondered how music and art meant somehow more than just the notes, rhythms, and nuances, but somehow the lattice of sounds and ideas evoked an order that was more than the sum of the parts. I was so driven by this question I wrote my masters thesis to the question, exploring structuralism and Jungian psychology to look for an answer. \n And on other days I sided with Felix Mendelssohn, who complained, “There is so much talk about music, and yet so little is said. For my part, I believe that words do not suffice for such a purpose.” \n There were times when I turned to the scriptures and church leaders, as well as to my university professors, for spiritual direction in looking for my answer. I read the Psalms, early hymns of praise and worship and considered the Lord’s words in DC 25:12: “For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads.” I knew that music was important to our Heavenly Father, for in D\u0026C 136:28 I read: “If thou art merry, praise the Lord with singing, with music, with dancing, and with a prayer of praise and thanksgiving.” I remembered at the conclusion of the Last Supper, before the Lord went out to the garden, that Christ and the apostles sang a hymn. \n One day, as I was talking with Professor Robert Manookin, a composer on the BYU faculty, he told me with some earnestness, “I wonder what heavenly choirs sound like? I hear people talk about hearing choirs in the temple, or on other sacred occasions. What did they hear? \n Does it sound like Brahms? Or more like Palestrina? Or is it simple four-part harmony, like in the hymnbook? What is it about that heavenly sound that is so wonderful, that carries such deep meaning into the hearts of those who hear it? That’s what I want to write!” \n So I went off to graduate school at Columbia University to study musicology. Perhaps they could teach me what composers meant by their music. I spent days with Josquin’s breathtakingly beautiful motet, “Ave Maria, gratia plena” and Bach’s cantata, “Christ lag in Todesbanden.” I learned the poignant story of Michael Haydn’s Requiem and how it affected the young, 16-year old Mozart who played in the orchestra in 1771 and then later partially recreated the work in his own Requiem 20 years later. \n When I finished school I became a teacher, facing my first class of freshmen at the University of Michigan 25 years ago. I then asked myself, “What is it about music that brings them here? What does music mean for them?” \n I knew some were there because they were pushed—by parents, friends, or teachers. Some were driven by ambition to conquer the stages of Classical stardom. Most, however, I knew were there because of a more idealistic purpose, because they loved their art. These students, probably, had survived life-changing experiences like those I passed through in my childhood, sitting in the orchestra and playing the Finale from Stravinsky’s Firebird Suite— when, as the solo horn entered on top of that quiet, shimmering string tremolo, my heart skipped several beats and I knew, this is what I want to do all of my life. I could look into the eyes of most of my students and see that same fire, a meaning they carried in their heart—even if we found it impossible to express that meaning in words, exactly. \n I taught at Michigan for nine years, and then at Penn State for eight, and then came to BYU. Here I found something more than I had known. The level of music making was as high as anything I had seen elsewhere, but there was something deeper beneath the surface. I saw it in the tears of students singing of the resurrection while performing Mahler’s Second Symphony. I found it in the silent elevator I shared with two violinists who had just poured out their hearts to children in a cancer clinic in London, in the hearts of education students recently returned from teaching English through music in the orient, and in the face of an overwhelmed, shaken graduate student who, at the end of an independent readings course on music in fin-de-siécle Vienna, began weeping and cried out, “Now I understand what happened!” \n What drives them also drives us. Music has meaning. It is that which brings us here to this organ workshop today. It’s message changes us, makes us better, lifts and inspires us. We want, sometimes desperately, to help others hear what we hear, to feel the same thing we do, in something like the same way. \n You’ve come here to learn how to do that. You know that here you will find wonderful teachers who will help you with technique, share practical knowledge like registration or organ history, and explore new repertoire. Here you know you will find others like yourself who want to share and learn together. Most importantly, though, you come here in the hope of learning to communicate the meaning you find in music with others. \n You have an obligation and even a duty to do that. As the Lord reminded Oliver Cowdery (D\u0026C 6:10), “Behold thou hast a gift, and blessed art thou because of thy gift. Remember it is sacred and cometh from above.” Each of us is given a measure, a “talent” in a literal sense, “Unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one: to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey. And all this for the benefit of the church of the living God, that every man may improve upon his talent, that every man may gain other talents, yea, even an hundred fold…” (DC 82:17-18) \n So we will study and learn together, and then we will serve, lift, and inspire others. We will search for the meaning of what we do and how we can make our talent best serve others.\nWe know that technique is essential, but also that it is only a means to an end. We want to show, through music, how art can be a means in the hand of God to bless the lives, gladden the hearts, comfort the weary, and in some small way, give meaning to life. \n Years ago I was sitting alone (or so I thought) in a dimly lit chapel, playing hymns on the piano. A silent observer finally rose, came forward, and paid me one of the highest compliments I’ve ever received as a musician. She said, “When you play the hymns, I hear the meaning of those words so strong, like you are singing to my heart.” When we are able to convey the message of our art to others, that’s when we succeed, I believe. \n Welcome to BYU. I hope some of spirit of this place will help you in your quest as a musician and servant. I hope what you learn and take with you will help you express those things that you find to be most important in life and in eternity—to inspire and “Lift up the hands that hang down.” Music can do this. \n Andrew E. Unsworth\n2007 \n It is an honor to be asked to speak today and to participate in this workshop. I’ve been privileged to teach several times during this week, and I’ve always come away renewed in my love of the gospel and church music and feeling grateful to be numbered among you as a laborer in the Kingdom. \n As I’ve considered what I might talk about, my thoughts have settled on a comment President Boyd K. Packer gave in his April 2007 General Conference address. Some of his remarks are related to issues in church music with which I struggled for a number of years. I am directing my thoughts today towards LDS organists, especially those who currently play for the sacrament meetings of their wards, but the issues I’ll address exist to varying degrees in many denominations. \n President Packer explained how, having recently been called as a General Authority and feeling somewhat inadequate and in need of spiritual strength, he entered the back of theSaltLakeTabernacletolistentoPrimaryConference. Hedescribedthemusicheheard and the feelings it brought to him. He also recounted the approach the organist took to the accompaniment of the choir: “As the children sang quietly, the organist, who understood that excellence does not call attention to itself, did not play a solo while they sang. He skillfully, almost invisibly blended the young voices into a melody of inspiration, of revelation.”1 \n I want to focus my remarks on our pursuit of excellence as organists. How do we manifest musical excellence and not call attention to ourselves? How can we strive to \n 1 Boyd K. Packer, “The Spirit of the Tabernacle,” Ensign (May 2007): 26. \n improve our musical skills and still approach our service playing with humility? And, how can we improve our efforts to invite the Holy Spirit through music and facilitate revelation? \n In many respects, it may seem counterintuitive that one might be able to be excellent and not draw attention to oneself. Doesn’t excellence by definition stand out from the ordinary? And, if the ideal performance is one that doesn’t draw undue attention to itself, why do we bother spending all of this time and money to improve our skills on the organ? \n First, we have to remember that there is a distinct difference between excellence and mere “flashiness.” While true greatness on the organ can be manifested in a technical exhibition, an awareness of one’s performance context is important. I do not doubt that most of you would agree that playing complicated interludes and accompaniments to hymns and virtuosic preludes and postludes is not generally appropriate for sacrament meetings. At the same time, I imagine that many of you would be disappointed if you attended an organ concert by a famous performer and heard only pieces played out of an organ method book. \n We also need to remember that incompetence draws attention to itself as much as or more than flashiness does. We have all experienced church meetings in which an organist or pianist struggled to make it through a sacrament meeting with his or her dignity intact—and maybe sometimes that someone was us. Since we belong to a church with a lay ministry, where organists are called to their positions regardless of their previous experience, such situations are bound to happen. And this is not an issue unique to the LDS Church or the twenty-first century. We can all doubtless identify with the comments of Nathaniel Gould, a nineteenth-century American musical commentator, describing the state of organ playing in the 1830s and 40s: \n When the rapid introduction of organs took place, it was not so difficult to procure the organs as to provide competent organists. It was represented by those who were interested that any one might, in a short time, qualify himself to play plain psalmody; consequently, young ladies and gentlemen, old men and maidens, made the attempt. \n But it was found not to be the work of a day, or a month, to learn to manage an organ so as to satisfy singers or hearers. Some one, perhaps, would attempt, with little experience in execution, time or harmony, the singers and organist hobbling along in sweet confusion. Complaints are made; the organist is mortified, if not provoked; stays away from church, – no organist.2 \n I lived in a ward for a time where the pianist in priesthood meeting really struggled to get through hymns. This good brother was teaching himself to play the piano, but he hadn’t yet mastered the concepts of rhythm and meter—he’d add a beat here or take a beat away there. One Sunday, the brethren in the ward close to the piano were struggling to figure out where the beat lay, while the brethren on the other side of the room continued to plow ahead, singing the hymn in time. The result was utter chaos. Ultimately, the hymn disintegrated as the priesthood body burst into gales of laughter, and the hymn had to be attempted again. While mistakes and the occasional disaster are inevitable when human beings are making music, and although I’m sure many of the men present at this meeting enjoyed having a good laugh, one person’s ego was deflated, and the purpose of music in the meeting was defeated. \n The problem that President Packer has doubtless experienced and that he implies in his comments is that some organists don’t understand that when playing in an LDS church service, one should strive to draw the attention of the congregation towards the spiritual purpose of the meeting and away from oneself. Those who haven’t figured this out yet exhibit a certain type of spiritual and artistic immaturity: as they gain skills they want to use them, and they may do so without much discrimination. This has been an issue for quite some time. John Sullivan Dwight, a venerable nineteenth-century American musical commentator, reported on a church service witnessed in New York City in 1865: \n 2 Nathaniel D. Gould, Church Music in America (Boston: A. N. Johnson, 1853), 180. \n [The organist] commenced to play the Old Hundred. At first, majestic as it should be, but soon his left hand began to get unruly among the bass notes, then the right cut up a few monkey shines in the treble; left threw in a large assortment of quavers; right led off with a grand flourish and a few dozen variations; left struggled mournfully to keep up, but soon gave up dead beat, and after that went back to first principles, and hammered away religiously at Old Hundred in spite of the antics of its fellow; right struck up a march–marched into a quick step–quick step into a gallop; left still kept at Old Hundred; right put in all sorts of fancy extras, to entice the left from its sense of propriety; left still unmoved; right put in a few bars of a popular waltz; left wavers a little; right strikes left still unmoved; right put in a few bars of a popular waltz; left wavers a little; right strikes up a favorite polka; left evidently yielding; right dashes into a jig; left now fairly deserts his colors and goes over to the enemy, and both commence an animated hornpipe, leaving poor Old Hundred to take care of itself. At length with a crash, a squeak, a rush, a roar, a rumble, and an expiring groan, the overture concluded and the service began.3 \n On another occasion, Dwight printed some observations on an organ postlude: \n You may easily imagine how the closing voluntary in most cases is performed: the organist sometimes draws out every stop in his organ, and quite forgetting the place where he is playing, and only thinking of displaying the dexterity of his fingers, performs overtures, grand marches, etc.; and it has sometimes really seemed to me as though he aimed to drown the impression made by a solemn sermon, or as though he wished to express his joy that the sermon was ended.4 \n As a young man, I often used my postludes in church as a platform for testing new repertoire and displaying my technique. I remember one Sunday, playing the Widor toccata or some other flashy piece, and hearing later from a friend that an older sister in the ward sat in the back during my postlude shaking her head in dismay. At the time, my reaction was to scoff: “Ignoramus! What does she know about great music!” Another occasion, on Pentecost Sunday, I was playing the postlude to a Church Educational System fireside. Since it was Pentecost and I was feeling rather proud of my new-found knowledge of the liturgical year, I decided to play the variations from Duruflé’s Veni Creator. As I began the final toccata, a well-meaning usher came up to me and asked me to play more quietly—that people were having a hard time talking. I was incensed at the usher’s lack of respect towards \n 3 Dwight’s Journal of Music 25 (22 July 1865): 72.\n4 “Church Music,” Dwight’s Journal of Music 1 (18 September 1852): 189. \n a beautiful piece, but more particularly at her disregard of my preparation for the occasion and my technical capability. \n Now, with a few more years of experience under my belt, I am embarrassed about my former approach to church music. What changed my attitude? For one, I got older, and hopefully wiser. Also, I had numerous experiences with church music outside of my own tradition, and these helped me better understand the historical context of LDS church music. \n As an undergraduate at BYU, I served for two years as the Organ Scholar at the Cathedral of the Madeleine in Salt Lake City. During graduate school, I also worked for several years as an organist and choir director at Lutheran and Baptist churches. After I received my degree, I returned to Salt Lake and spent five more years at the Cathedral of the Madeleine, serving this time as the Organist and Assistant Director of Music. Through these experiences, I gained an appreciation for other Christian denominations, their good works, sincereandbeautifulworship,andrichartistictraditions. Oneofthewonderfulpartsabout these church jobs, especially my position at the Madeleine, was to be able to perform some of the world’s finest sacred choral and organ music in the setting for which it was written. I found that experiencing this great religious art in its original context heightened my understanding of and appreciation for the composers and the situations in which they labored. After several years of living within the rhythm of the liturgical year, I acquired a sense of the function of much of this music, and it now it seems a little strange to me to sit and listen to a Mass or other sacred compositions in a secular, concert setting. \n Most American Protestant churches in the first half of the nineteenth century had an ambivalent relationship with the pipe organ. Except in the largest cities, elaborate church music and especially pipe organs were uncommon—they were seen generally as “papist” (a serious insult back in those days). Instead, most church music was congregational and \n humble, and when organs finally became more widespread in American churches, congregations and musical commentators were quite conservative in the types of organ literature they deemed appropriate for use in divine service. A reporter from Philadephia wrote in 1863: \n Among the masters of composition a style of organ playing is recognized, called the free style; we mean that free style which has never been recognized as any part of church music. Compositions of this class are written for the organ exhibition or the concert. They have no place in church. They are light, sportive and showy. They will never predispose the mind to devotion. They were never intended to do this.5 \n Eugene Thayer, a well-known nineteenth-century American organist and pedagogue, went so far as to prescribe what composers’ compositions should not be played in services: “[I]t must be remembered that neither Bach nor Handel left us any organ music suitable for the introductionofchurchservice,asmostmusiciansofourdayunderstandit.”6 Nineteenth- century Americans were also well-aware how inappropriate music can destroy the spirit of a worship service: \n Light minds are pleased with trifles, and such persons forget the service they are engaged in. The true style of organ music is that which casts noble hints into the soul, not the merely pretty style, which affects no part of the head but the ear, and touches not the heart. \n A celebrated writer of a century and a half ago, says of certain organists who introduced irreligious music into their voluntaries: “These fingering gentlemen should be informed that they ought to suit their airs to the place and business; and that the musician is obliged to keep to the text as much as the preacher. For want of this, I have found by experience a great deal of mischief; for, when the preacher has often, with great piety and art enough, handled his subject, and I have found in myself, and in the rest of the pew, good thoughts and dispositions, they have been all in a moment dissipated by a jig from the organ-loft.”7 \n Out of this context sprang our early LDS musical practice: it did not include organ music at all in the beginning, and the great choral and organ works do not belong to it. I’m \n 5 “How They Play the Organ in Church,” The Monthly Choir and Organ Journal 1 (May 1863): 97-98.\n6 Eugene Thayer, “Service Preludes,” The Organist’s Quarterly Journal and Review 1 (July 1874): 3.\n7 James Hewins, Hints Concerning Church Music (Boston: A. Williams \u0026 Co., 1857), 33. \n not saying, as Thayer did, that one can’t play Bach or Handel in church; in my opinion, however, if we play “classical” or art music from outside our own tradition in sacrament meeting, we must be aware that we are bringing in a foreign element, and we should do so with the utmost care. How do we decide when it is appropriate to do so? This is where we need to use our keenest spiritual sensitivity and best communication skills. We should talk to our priesthood leaders and ascertain their vision for music in worship service. Even if the minds of our leaders are so consumed by other matters that music is the least of their worries, we should, in my opinion, do all in our power to retain or regain their trust—to insure that music never becomes a concern for them. \n So if the organ repertoire I am learning is generally not appropriate for use in a sacrament meeting, why should I bother practicing it? Well, it’s great art, and great art uplifts and edifies, often regardless of the context in which it is experienced. Some of my most powerful spiritual experiences through music have occurred in the solitude of a practice room. But the natural man can be lazy, and I often need more motivation than that. I have learned that nothing gets me to the practice room or church as frequently as knowledge that I’ll be playing a piece in public in the near future. I strongly encourage you to cultivate performance opportunities in contexts in addition to sacrament meeting. Arrange for a ward or stake hymnsing, give a solo or group recital, get involved with your local AGO chapter. You’ll find that great music is even more satisfying when performed in the appropriate context. \n Sometimes problems arise when our hearts are right, but our intentions are misunderstood, and even here, the blame can often be placed squarely on our own shoulders. As we grow in ability, our congregations grow with us, becoming accustomed to more registral variety, varied harmonies, and generally more skilful playing. Problems may \n arise if, say, one is called to be an organist in a ward where one has never served before. If I were to show up in an unfamiliar congregation, and give every hymn “the treatment” (in the words of Gerre Hancock), altering harmony, adding non-harmonic tones, and including elaborate interludes, even if it were a festive occasion and my intentions were pure, my hymn playing would doubtless be interpreted as a prideful display, and it would be distracting to the congregation. To avoid being misunderstood when one is new to a congregation, it would be wise to exercise extreme restraint in one’s playing at first, and, after consultation with one’s bishop, gradually introduce the congregation to some of the hymn playing techniques you’ll learn about this week. \n Of course, we should seek after anything that is lovely, of good report, or praiseworthy. But when we seek to gratify our pride or vain ambition through our performance in sacrament meeting, we lose the spirit, and we are no longer playing for the right reasons. Can you not imagine the pleasure that the Lord must take in organists who create an atmosphere conducive to revelation through their humble service? And can you not imagine the pleasure (and, yes, revelations) that such organists receive as they approach their performance in sacrament meeting in this manner, combining technical proficiency, modesty, and meekness. I know many of you have already experienced this. \n I’m not arguing for a dumbing-down of LDS church music. Instead, I’m acknowledging that all great music has a place, and for historical and cultural reasons, we must choose with special care what music we play in church services and how we approach our hymn playing. I recognize how difficult it is to retain motivation to practice and strive for excellence when mediocrity is tolerated in and even celebrated by popular culture. Your presence here today demonstrates a desire to rise above the mire, and for this I admire and applaud you. \n I want to draw your thoughts to a day a month or so in the future. The glow with which you will leave this workshop will have departed by then. You may be somewhat discouraged at lack of progress or practice time, or you may feel unappreciated. Practicing the organ can be a lonely, solitary affair, and most of us have to go to a cold, dark church to rehearse (there’s a reason why organists tend to be such strange people). In spite of your efforts to improve the quality of music in your ward, people may continue to talk through your preludes and postludes, and doubtless few will appreciate your subtleties of registration, articulation, and smooth legato. But please know that your efforts in the service of the Lord are important and they are noticed. They are important because they demonstrate your commitment to the Lord and your desire to serve Him to the best of your ability. And regardless of how you may feel at times, your efforts are noticed—and not just by the angels. I have had the experience on multiple occasions, as I’m sure many of you have had, that even the most unmusical ward member will be aware from the first Sunday you play that something is different, even if all you do is play the hymns straight through as written with good legato, well-articulated repeated notes, and appropriate registration. And what is not excellentaboutthat? Isthereanyshameinplayingwell,evenifyouareplayingsomething simple? Success in any venture demands our best efforts, especially when we venture to serve the Lord. \n To conclude, I’d like to return to President Packer’s conference talk. President Packer described the spiritual experience he had at Primary Conference as the organist played and the choir sang as a “defining moment . . . [that] fixed deeply and permanently in mysoulthatwhichImostneededtosustainmeintheyearstofollow.”8 Ifwestriveto perfect our organ technique and to approach our performance in sacrament meeting \n 8 Packer, 26. \n remembering, as President Packer said, that music “cannot be separated from the voice of the Lord, the quiet, still voice of the Spirit,” your ward members will remember how they felt and the testimony they gained as they sang the hymns of Zion to your accompaniment. And most importantly, the giver of all gifts will make you a “ruler over many things,” as you enter into the joy of our Lord. \n Keynote Address by Parley L. Belnap\nAugust 5, 2008 \n The Lord has given us our agency, which is necessary for our growth and development. We are accountable, not only for our actions and words, but also for our thoughts and we must accept the consequences for our choices. Thanks to the atonement of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, we are not locked in to past unacceptable choices. The scriptures emphasize these points many times. In Proverbs we read: “For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he.” (Proverbs 23:7) \n President James E. Faust gave a wonderful sermon on the power of self-mastery at the General Conference Priesthood Session in April 2000: \n Every human soul . . . has the challenge of controlling his or her thoughts, appetites, speech, temper, desires. . . I now turn to mastery of our own private thoughts. In this realm, conscience is the only referee that can blow the whistle when we get out of control. If not bridled, our thoughts can run wild. Our minds are a part of us that really require discipline and control. [President James E. Faust, “The Power of Self-Mastery,” Ensign, May 2000] \n In the book But I Played It Perfectly in the Practice Room, we read: \n When we internalize the fact that we become what we think, we are more encouraged to consider our thoughts, and explore the many possibilities and options that may be actualized in us. [Charlotte Sibley Whitaker, Donald Ray Tanner; But I Played It Perfectly in the Practice Room; (Lanham, Maryland 20706: University Press of America, 1987), p. 56.] \n So critical is it that we understand the necessity of controlling our thoughts that President Spencer W. Kimball devoted a whole chapter to it in his book The Miracle of Forgiveness. [Spencer W. Kimball, The Miracle of Forgiveness, Chapter 8, “As a Man Thinketh,” (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1969)] \n In Galatians 6:7-8 we read: “Be not deceived; God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. He that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.” \n In LDS Hymn 216, we find the following: \n We are sowing, daily sowing Countless seeds of good and ill, By a whisper sow we blessings, By a breath we scatter strife, \n In our words and thoughts and actions \n Lie the seeds of death and life. \n The scientific as well as the medical world emphasizes the strong unity and correlation between the mind and body. A poem I have heard frequently clearly tells the relationship and importance of our thoughts: \n Sow a thought and you reap an act; Sow an act and you reap a habit;\nSow a habit and you reap a character; Sow a character and you reap a destiny. \n William James wrote, “The greatest revolution of my life is the discovery that individuals can change the outer aspects of their lives by changing the inner attitudes of their minds.” \n Brian Tracy states: \n Your thoughts vividly imagined and repeated, charged with emotion, become your reality. Almost everything you have in your life has been created by your own thinking. \n Put another way, thoughts are things. They take on a life of their own. First you have them, then they have you. You act in a manner consistent with what you are thinking about most of the time. You eventually become what you think about. And if you change your thinking you change your life. . .The one thing you must do is to create the mental equivalent of what you want to experience in reality. [Brian Tracy, Maximum Achievement, (New York City: Simon and Schuster, 1993), \n p. 56.] \n Great emphasis is put on positive thinking and positive attitudes as a major part in overcoming illness, personal problems, developing good marriage relationships, developing good work relationships, preventing problems and promoting health. Textbooks, scientific books, and self-help books have been written in the past twenty or so years on relaxing, mental practicing, overcoming stage fright, and preventing overuse problems of the hands and arms. There is great emphasis on retraining the mind by retraining and controlling our thoughts. \n Regarding controlling our thoughts in our performances, let me tell you some of my personal challenges. But first I will give a brief introduction to my developing an interest in music. As a child my thoughts, desires and interests were beginning to be channeled into music. When I was nine years old, I started piano lessons with my Aunt Mabel Belnap in my hometown of Hooper, Utah. I loved the piano and loved to practice. \n My introduction to performing in church began when I was twelve years old and I was ordained a deacon. Bishop Levi Beus was bishop of the Hooper Ward of the Weber Stake in Weber County, west of Ogden, Utah. He called me to play the piano for priesthood meeting. I had been taking piano lessons from my Aunt for three years. I enjoyed this calling. I even made my own piano arrangement of Come, Come Ye Saints, which seemed to please the priesthood leaders and members. I suppose I did it for the 24th of July one year. \n When I was a teenager, KSL radio broadcast 15 minutes each weekday of the half-hour noon recitals of the Tabernacle Organ on Temple Square. When I was out of school during the summers, I listened faithfully to these broadcasts. It was a wonderful introduction to the organ for me and I truly learned to love its sound. I also listened Sunday evenings to a radio program called “Sunday Evening on Temple Square”––a broadcast of a half-hour organ recital by Alexander Schreiner and also Frank W. Asper. I also regularly listened to a radio broadcast of E. Power Biggs playing the organ from the Harvard Germanic Museum in Boston, Massachusetts. So my interest and love for the organ was being developed. \n I was blessed with two fine piano teachers who prepared me well for a later choice to be an organist. I had many opportunities to accompany choirs, soloists, and play the piano with the Weber High School Orchestra and at Weber College in Ogden. I started organ lessons when I was a junior at BYU, where I was one of the piano accompanists for the major choirs. I loved music and the opportunity to serve. \n Sometime later I was blessed with a scholarship from the Belgian-American Educational Foundation to study for two years with Flor Peeters at the Royal Flemish Conservatory in Antwerp, Belgium. \n At the end of my second year, I was working toward a diploma in organ performance at the Conservatory. I would like to relate to you a personal experience which shows inadequate control of my thoughts: \n I had to prepare two examinations, one exam being a recital program. The jury consisted of 5 judges from the conservatories of Belgium and Holland. One of the pieces I played was the Chorale in E Major by Cesar Franck.. I was playing well and when I got to the last page, I congratulated myself and was thinking “you have played this piece without a mistake—just one page to go.” Pride goeth before the fall. Ten measures from the end I goofed in a pedal passage. I was devastated but was still awarded the diploma with honors. So it is a mistake to congratulate yourself before it is over. I didn’t keep my thoughts focused until the end. This work lasts 15 minutes and I didn’t endure to the end. My advice is “control your thoughts; it isn’t over until it is actually over.” I have learned much from this experience. \n In performing, it is so easy to worry and wonder when you will make a mistake. Perhaps you think of some fine musician in the audience and what he or she will be thinking. This is disruptive to you and your performance. We need to recreate the music, keeping focused on the joy of making beautiful music for the edification of our fellowmen and for the glory of God. If we allow worries to come into our thoughts, they could well become a self-fulfilling prophecy. \n Prepare well and trust your preparation. Think ahead somewhat, think in larger units, avoid worry, but trust. Mental rehearsal and controlling your thinking will be a stabilizing source for your performance. Avoid the fear of making a mistake. It will cause you to have a problem. \n Flor Peeters, my teacher at the Royal Flemish Conservatory, told me that I needed to practice more at my table, meaning to practice mentally. Because I was on a scholarship, I was practicing 6 to 8 hours a day but needed to practice more effectively. He said that I should go through the music in my mind with my thoughts, visualizing the music and recreating it mentally. I determined to practice consistently both physically and mentally. The results were amazing. I felt I had learned the music in half the time. In addition, my performance was more secure and with much less mind wandering. \n The principle of mental practicing is a regular and important part of sports training, as well as other performance-related activities. This clearly emphasizes the point that controlling our thoughts is a major part of controlling our actions. \n The Germans have a saying, “We cannot prevent the birds from flying overhead, but we can prevent them from nesting in our hair.” This means that we can’t always control the thoughts that enter the mind, but we can control whether or not we let them stay. \n Vicktor Frankl was a neurologist, a psychiatrist, and a very wealthy man in Vienna when the Nazis took over. He spent several years of his life in concentration camps, surviving unspeakable atrocities at the hands of his captors. In his book Man’s Search for Meaning, Vicktor Frankl writes: \n The experience of camp life shows that man does have a choice of action. There were enough examples, often of a heroic nature, which proved that apathy could be overcome, irritability suppressed. Man can preserve a vestige of spiritual freedom, of independence of mind, even in such terrible conditions of psychic and physical stress. There is sufficient proof that everything can be taken from man but one thing: the last of human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s way. [Vicktor Frankl, Man’s Search for Meaning (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1939), pp. 103-104] \n We are challenged by the Lord, Latter-day prophets and apostles and leaders to control our thoughts. Scientific research has emphasized the importance of the mind/body relationship. Medical research indicates the importance of controlling our thoughts, attitudes, and feelings as an important factor in a healthy life style. Sport leaders and other performance-area leaders stress the importance of the mind in relaxation, skill achievement, and performance. In fact, mental rehearsal is advocated in order to prevent and overcome overuse problems of the hands, arms, legs and general body. It is a help in concentration and a preventative for mind wandering in any type of performance. So controlling and channeling our thoughts is very important—how we engage the mind in what we do. \n Boyd K. Packer states, \n “Probably the greatest challenge to people of any age, particularly young people, and the most difficult thing you will face in mortal life it to learn to control your thoughts. “As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.” (Proverbs 23:7) One who can control his thoughts has conquered himself. [Boyd K. Packer, “Inspiring Music–Worthy Thoughts,” Ensign, January 1974, p. 25] \n In Doctrine and Covenants 38: 30, we read, “If ye are prepared ye shall not fear.” Your preparation gives stability and the ability to perform well and consistently. You will perform generally how you practice. Some practical things I have learned for performance may be of help to you: \n 6. Practice for 25 minutes and then take a five-minute break. This will help you avoid overuse and help you avoid mind wandering in performance. \n 7. Keep your mind active and alert as you practice. See patterns in music; notice repetitions, musical shapes, cadences, etc. Discover all you can about the music you play. \n 8. Avoid mindless repetitions; it will help you avoid mind wandering when you perform. 9. Plan your practice; set realistic goals for each practice session. \n In the book But I Played it Perfectly in the Practice Room by Whitaker and Tanner, we read: \n Recent research has produced amazing results in determining that an extremely large amount of our responses are directly related to the attitudes and thoughts within our mind. [Whitaker and Tanner, But I Played it Perfectly in the Practice Room, p. 37.] \n President Ezra Taft Benson has stated: \n The Lord said, “Look unto me in every thought.” (D\u0026C 6:36) Looking to the Lord in every thought is the only possible way we can be the manner of men and women we ought to be. \n The Lord asked the question of His disciples, “ What manner of men ought ye to be?” He answered his own question by saying, “Even as I am” (3 Nephi 27:27) To become as He is, we must have Him on our mind—constantly in our thoughts. Every time we partake of the Sacrament, we commit to “always remember Him.” \n If thoughts make us what we are, and we are to be like Christ, then we must think Christlike thoughts. Let me repeat that: if thoughts make us what we are and we are to be like Christ, we must think Chrislike thoughts. \n Paul, en route to Damascus to persecute the Saints, saw a light from Heaven and heard the voice of the Lord. Then Paul asked a simple eight-word question—and the persistent asking of the same question changed his life. “Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?” (Acts 9:6) The persistent asking of that same question can change your life. There is no greater question that you can ask in this world. “Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?” [President Ezra Taft Benson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, “Think on Christ,” Ensign, April 1984, p. 9] \n A wonderful example of obedience to this thought, “Lord, what wilt thou have me do,” is the following story of Clara Neu, which I have permission to use. Quoting Sister Neu’s own words: \n My maiden name was Clara Grover Tilton, and I was at Syracuse University from the fall of 1956 to June of 1960, when I graduated with a BM in organ performance, summa cum laude and also received the Outstanding Music Student Award of the year. Dr. Poister, who never wanted to be called that, only Mr. Poister, was my teacher every semester except one, when he went on sabbatical. I was very blessed that way – I had no idea when I auditioned for him and asked him whether, if I came to Syracuse University, he would be my teacher, that he really didn’t teach undergraduate students anymore. He assured me at that time that he would teach me, and so it was. \n May I interject that Arthur Poister is considered by many to have been one of the greatest organ teachers of the world. In 1979 at BYU he gave the last master class of his life. Continuing Sister Neu’s story: \n My study with Anton Heiller in Vienna, Austria, began in the fall of 1960 on a Fulbright Scholarship and lasted until spring of the next year. \n Again, parenthetically, Anton Heiller had an international reputation, with students coming from all over the world to study with him. Continuing with Sister Neu’s words: \n Brother Ray Arbizu, a voice teacher from BYU, was on a Fulbright Scholarship in the same group as myself. Heavenly Father saw to it, frankly, that I was quite humbled at the time and looking for an anchor in my life. I had been a Methodist. I joined that church at junior high school age in order to participate in the choir program, and because I was studying organ and piano with the Methodist organist, John Ferris, who later became the university organist at Yale University. \n I had a childhood testimony of Jesus Christ, but did not have more than that inside. A fellow Fulbrighter, Ann Alberts and I went at Ann’s instigation to see Marion and Ray Arbizu. Ann had said that if anyone could help me at that point in my life, it would be the Arbizus. They taught us the gospel with tears in their eyes, until 2:00 am.with young children wailing to be put to bed. I felt something different and remarkable in the Arbizu apartment. The Holy Spirit bore abundant and generous witness to me that what I was hearing was true, and I needed to do something about it. The Arbizus gave Ann and me a Book of Mormon, but Ann would not let me have it at first, saying that I had not read enough in the Bible. So I commenced there, and soon got the chance to read in the Book of Mormon. Also, Ray and Marion gave us a copy of “The Articles of Faith” by James Talmage. I read that also from cover to cover and checked out every single footnote in the scriptures…. It all added up. \n Ann and I went back to the Arbizus and Ray asked if we would like to come to church. We did, and it was very nice. I was impressed by the simplicity—there was no chapel in Vienna in 1961, and we met in a rented room over an auto-body shop. But the spirit of sincerity was strong, and I found it without frills, but honest and good. \n Ray Arbizu finally asked if we would like meet with the missionaries, and I remember saying to him, “Well, is that how we get in?” On our first meeting, one of the elders said to us that if we would read the Book of Mormon, we would come to know that it was true. I remember replying that I already knew it was true. He then looked quickly at his companion and said he would like us to prepare to be baptized. We were both baptized (and are both still active in the church) in a swimming pool, the Deanabad, by Ray Arbizu himself on 17 January 1961. . . For me the story becomes a little more difficult at that point. I wrote a letter home to my parents telling them that I was investigating the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The next letter that I wrote home was to tell them that I had been baptized. Mother came as quickly as she could to talk me out of that commitment. She….was determined that I should not continue as a Mormon, and was unwilling to listen to anyone’s defenses. And so with this battle raging, my study shortly ended in Vienna. We came home and continued the fight. \n I had been accepted at Union Theological Seminary as an organ student candidate for the Master of Sacred Music degree, planning before my joining this church to be a protestant organist and choirmistress and went there that fall. I completed the degree but felt that my organ teacher, Vernon de Tar, resented my new found religion. My mother had a confrontational interview at one point during those two years at Union with the Dean of Students as to why no one had been able to turn my mind back to being a Protestant. \n John Schreiner, Alexander Schreiner’s son, brought her to church the first time she went to the Manhattan Ward in New York City. Clara met Robert Neu there and began a courtship. They married August 3, 1963, in the Manhattan Ward and were sealed two weeks later in the Swiss Temple. Their seven children were born in New York. Clara Neu decided to direct her efforts eventually to her family and gave up her position in the Christian Science Church at Red Bank. Sister Neu remembers not wanting to have conflict and questions from their children as to why Mother went somewhere else to church. She decided that she was going to go where her family went and where she wanted them to be; so she closed the chapter of trying to be a professional church organist. \n Back to Sister Neu’s own words: \n All five of our sons have served missions. All five of our children’s marriages so far have been temple marriages. We have been active in the church all the time. We have prioritized Church participation in our lives, feeling that the gospel and the church were of paramount importance, and if we could do other things also, it would be fine, but nothing at the expense of the first. I feel that we have been greatly blessed. \n Our missions here in London are a delight. This is the first mission we have served. Robert is truly the office boy, and enjoys it. I run the concert series at the Hyde Park Chapel. Our first concert of the Winter Series was 17 January 2008, and we just had the last one, an organ concert 2 August 2008 by Ruth Eldredge. It was lovely. My calling is also to teach organ and piano. I have three or four active organ students and about 40 piano students. I have some real young children, some teenagers and then quite a few adults. All are beginning to intermediate level. . . I do think this work is worthwhile. \n The Lord knows us, our talents, our needs, and our thoughts and desires. If we keep our thoughts pure and directed to do His will he will be able to use us in the great Latter-day work, as he is using Sister Neu. What a great blessing for her, Brother Neu, and for others in London, England! What a wonderful example of a person acting on righteous thoughts and impressions! \n Controlling our thoughts blesses various aspects of our lives–from the practical to the spiritual. In the words of Elder Boyd K Packer, “I have come to know that thoughts, like water, will stay on its course if we make a place for them to go.” [Elder Boyd K. Packer, “Inspiring Music–Worthy Thoughts,” Ensign, January, 1974, p. 25] \n Especially, may our thoughts be of Christ, and may we strive to be more like him, love and serve Him with all our heart, soul, and mind, and always remember Him. \n Keynote Address by Bonnie L. Goodliffe\nAugust 4, 2009 \n I am humbled at the prospect of speaking to you today. I pray that I may say something helpful to each of you. \n I was in my senior year at BYU when this building first opened. I walked by the construction site almost every day before it was completed. I spent three additional years roaming these halls as a graduate student. I have many sweet memories tied to this building Most of the special faculty members that I knew are gone now. Even people I went to school with who were on the faculty are retired now. People younger than I am are running the department. This continues to astonish me. I still think of myself as being about 29, maybe 31. \n I feel that I have been very fortunate to have been in the right place at the right time to have had the experiences that I have had. I have had excellent teachers, indispensable family encouragement and support, wonderful mentors, and unlikely opportunities. I never expected to be able to spend so much time in musical activities. I have, for some reason, been given the chance to do many of the things that I would have thought to be impossible \n I believe that one of the things which has made these experiences possible is my topic today. Let me illustrate with three seemingly unrelated items. I hope you will see the connection by the time I finish this talk, or I will be very embarrassed. \n #1 Some years ago I read a Dear Abby column which had a great influence on me. It must have affected many others too, judging by the letters which were printed as a result. The column has been re-printed numerous times It deals with a decision to go to medical school, but that is irrelevant here. \n “Dear Abby: I am a 36-year-old college dropout whose lifelong ambition was to be a physician. I have a very good job selling pharmaceutical supplies, but my heart is still in the practice of medicine. I do volunteer work at the local hospital on my time off, and people tell me I would have been a wonderful doctor. \n “If I go back to college and get my degree, then go to medical school, do my internship and finally get into the practice of medicine, it will take me seven years. But Abby, in seven years I will be 43 years old! What do you think? \n (Signed) “Unfulfilled in Philly” \n (She answers) “Dear Unfulfilled: And how old will you be in seven years if you don’t do it?” \n My Dear Brothers and Sisters, \n Page 1 of 5 \n #2 Years ago I saw an article in the newspaper about making lists to accomplish certain goals. Since I am a professional-caliber list maker, this appealed to me in a big way. Here is the gist: make a list of 100 things you want to do. (This is harder than you might think.) They can be things to buy, places to go, projects to complete, whatever. Then start working on them. Cross off each item as you complete it, and replace it with a new goal. I have my list in a spiral notebook, with 25 lines to a sheet. I draw a single line through the listing and date it when I complete an item, so I have a record of what I have done. Then I use that number for a new item. I, of course, have made several sub-lists grouping my 100 things into categories such as simple purchases, large-scale travel, household improvements, things which require time but no money, that sort of thing. One of the sub-categories I call “poco a poco – things which can be done a little at a time.” \n #3 1993 was the centennial year of the Salt Lake Temple. As you may know, it took 40 years to build. I never doubted this fact; I just didn’t consider the implications. During that centennial year, the temple construction was talked about at General Conference, written about in church magazines and various other books, documented in a special church motion picture, and featured in a wonderful exhibit at the church museum of history and art. Some of the details of the building problems finally made me realize what a stupendous project the temple was. I was stunned to learn that the entire foundation had to be dug up and re-done after the episode with Johnson’s Army. Cracks were found which necessitated virtually starting over. Elder Boyd K. Packer’s conference talk that April related that it took an ox team approximately one week to leave the Salt Lake Valley, arrive at the granite quarry, load one single block of granite, and travel back to the temple site in Salt Lake City. One week if nothing went wrong. If there were problems, of course it took longer than one week. I’m afraid that I would have found the situation so discouraging that I would have just given up on the whole thing. I would have said, “this is hopeless; we won’t live long enough to see this temple built.” Or “what a crazy idea; any realistic person can see that this is just a pipedream.” Fortunately for the church, I wasn’t there. Fortunately a prophet was in charge, a prophet who wasn’t limited by what was reasonable, or logical, or possible within an allotted time period. He just had the vision. And a mere forty years later, the temple was completed. \n Now to bring these three ideas together. I had realized that large-scale projects, including musical ones, could be effectively worked on a little at a time, but I had applied the concept only to known, near-term performances. I hadn’t envisioned how effective the idea could be with long-term musical goals. \n I belong to a group which calls itself the Piano Club. It was in existence long before I moved to Salt Lake City, and I am one of the younger members. It is an informal group of ladies who meet once a month during the school year and perform for each other. Sometimes, and by some people, the performances are very polished; some are less polished. We try things out on each other, sometimes before we are actually ready. Over the years I have played an assortment of things, mostly dredged up from my student days. But in 1985, the Bach year, I decided to revive the Bach B flat partita, which I like very much and which I had performed in high school. Many years before. I did just one movement each month. I really wasn’t practicing the piano much at the time. I enjoyed it so much, I decided to learn the second partita, which I had never completed. Then I did the third. And so on. So, in the spring of 1992 I realized that I had learned all six partitas and the overture in the French style. I hadn’t really set out to do that; it just sort of happened. But it was like a revelation to me. One of my musical life goals was to \n Page 2 of 5 \n learn all the partitas. I hadn’t really conceived of how or when that might happen. It was just a nebulous idea out there in space. But there it was, suddenly, done. \n I did the French Suites next. Since that time, I have also completed the Well- tempered Clavier, Book 1; the Goldberg Variations; and the English suites. I am now working on the Well-tempered Clavier, Book 2. \n Now it seems like almost nothing to learn just one movement of a Bach partita. Okay, that is an overstatement; a few of them are long and quite difficult, but most are just one or two pages. It is no gigantic accomplishment to learn one movement in a month. But the cumulative effect was remarkable to me. When I realized that I would complete the set, I thought of Abby’s answer. How old would I have been in 1992 if I hadn’t learned all the Bach partitas. I thought, “How many other musical things can I work on this way? How many non-musical things can I work on this way?” I came up with a long list (and sub-lists, of course.) \n You may think that you are not interested in this type of commitment. But remember there is no penalty for not accomplishing all that you hope for. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Count only the successful efforts, and forget the rest. The times you miss do not lessen the accomplishments of the past or the future. Close the door on any past lapses or failures, and move forward from wherever you are. You don’t have to commit never to miss a practice session in order to have practicing pay off for you. \n Ongoing diligence will improve your abilities. Whatever your musical circum- stances, you can learn new things. Look for instance at the 1985 hymnbook. Are you familiar with all the newer things in it, or is it still like the sealed portion of the golden plates to you? Could you learn one new hymn or mark one pedal part every month? \n How old will you be in 5 years if you don’t make such an effort? If you don’t use any initiative in your music calling? If you just squeak by week after week, collecting ideas and possibilities, but never applying them. The days and months and years will pass by just the same. But, one step a week or even one a month adds up to a fair distance down the road after a while. The cumulative effect can be impressive. But it does require a decision to make the effort, a decision about what direction to take. \n I have long been inspired by a statement of Elder Neal Maxwell’s. He wrote, “eternal things are always done in the process of time. . . . Direction is initially more important than speed.” (Of One Heart. Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1975, p.35) At least most of the time, try to be going in the right direction. I also like to remind myself of Alma’s admonition “by small and simple things are great things brought to pass.” (Alma 37:6) \n With regard to inching forward in the right direction, I hope you will allow me to share some things I have learned about preparation and attitude. \n I believe very strongly in careful preparation of your music. Thorough preparation is probably my best skill. It has saved me on many occasions. I know that if I work through every conceivable problem mentally, beforehand, I can overcome or eliminate the great majority of problems. I can even overcome a certain amount of performance anxiety ahead of time. \n Keep in mind that thorough preparation cannot be forced. I like this comment by the violinist Itzhak Perlman: “If you learn something fast you often forget it just as fast. \n Page 3 of 5 \n You need to give it time, let yourself grow with it, let it become a part of you. I don’t like practicing under pressure. I like to give a piece about a year, doing ten minutes here, twenty minutes there, letting the whole thing mature organically.” (“All Play is Work” (an interview with Itzhak Perlman by Jeremy Siepmann) BBC Music Magazine, May 1995, p. 22) Perlman refers to this as the “baking” method – putting something in the oven and coming back later when it’s ready to take out. A slow process, much like building the Salt Lake Temple one granite block at a time. \n In your performances, do not rely on your emotions. Emotion is not a legitimate substitute for technical skill. Do not rely on inspiration. The Lord can magnify your abilities but not if you have done nothing first. Remember that Nephi asked the Lord where to go to find ore. He didn’t ask the Lord to drop a set of ship-building tools into his tent. Even in church service, the angels may attend you, but they do not practice for you. \n I have a philosophy about working in church music which has been very successful for me. It is this: Take all the blame yourself. Never accuse anyone else of causing poor results. If your choir director never gives you music ahead of time, perhaps you could say to him or her, “I wish I had the skills to be able to do justice to this without so much practice, but I am so far just unable to do it.” If you don’t get the hymns ahead of time, offer to choose them yourself. Offer to come to the music director’s house to pick up the schedule. Ask which day you should telephone to find out what the music will be. If the musical numbers are inadequate or inappropriate, offer to line up some better ones. Don’t complain unless you are prepared to do something constructive to improve the situation. Do everything in your power to be a positive influence: on the quality of the music, on the quality of the presentation, on the testimonies of those you work with, and on the spirituality of the worship service. Remember that sometimes the most positive thing you can do is keep quiet. \n I would like to tell you two stories. True stories. A prominent citizen passed away. An equally prominent organist was asked to provide music at the funeral services. The organist arrived at the chapel, inspected the instrument, and declared it inadequate. The organist played the piano instead. I think this is a very sad story. I can hardly imagine any justification for such arrogance. I think it is a terrible insult to the grieving family. I have played some pretty poor instruments myself. I have played funeral music which I thought was quite inappropriate. But, I say, if the family wants it and the bishop approves it, then who am I to dictate to them? I have played – at funerals – The Stars and Stripes Forever, When the Saints Go Marchin’ In, and even Help Me Make it Through the Night. Don’t think that you are too good to play a particular instrument or a piece of music. Pride is a sin much worse than musical ignorance. \n The second story happened to me. I took my organ shoes to a shoe repair shop to have the suede soles glued back on. I explained to the young woman who was helping me that I was an organist and the significance of the suede soles. She actually seemed rather interested. Finally she said, “Have you ever played anyplace really big? Like a baseball game?” I smiled and said, “No, I’m sorry. I guess I haven’t.” \n If you find yourself thinking that you are quite accomplished, or quite important, or at least superior to those with less training and taste, remember the shoe repair shop. It will bring you back to reality. \n On one of my morning walks I was thinking about this talk and about goals and accomplishments and what was really possible in this lifetime. I had this bizarre idea. \n Page 4 of 5 \n What if, in the next life, I don’t get to work on all the things that I have been putting off until then. What if I get there, and there is a rule that I can only continue to work on projects that I have already started. What if I can’t begin anything brand new? What would happen if I protested and showed a long list of all the music I was planning to learn and all the skills I was planning to develop and the gatekeeper angel asked for some evidence that those things are truly important to me. I am going to feel pretty terrible about all those things I didn’t even try to accomplish–all those things on my list of 100 that just got shelved until I had that mythical chunk of free time. I am comforted to know that the Lord knows my heart and my mind, but what do my actions show? \n I have for many years loved Robert Frost’s poem “The Road Not Taken”. I like it even more since I learned Randall Thompson’s musical setting of the text, which I played on my very first broadcast of Music and the Spoken Word in 1988. I would like to share it with you in closing. \n Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both\nAnd be one traveler, long I stood\nAnd looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth; \n Then took the other, as just as fair,\nAnd having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same, \n And both that morning equally lay\nIn leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day!\nYet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back. \n I shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I– I took the one less traveled by,\nAnd that has made all the difference. \n (A Pocket Book of Robert Frost’s Poems, p.223. New York: Washington Square Press, Inc., 1963.) \n For me, and perhaps for many of you, church music in general and playing the organ in particular have become the road taken, and it has made all the difference. I wish you success in all your musical ambitions, and I am grateful that we are travelling companions on that road. \n Bonnie L. Goodliffe August 4, 2009 \n Page 5 of 5 \n Keynote Address by Mike Ohman\nAugust 3, 2010 \n I ask your forgiveness as I speak to you today. I have felt prompted to share some very personal experiences. \n A few months ago, Elder David A. Bednar gave a moving talk to the missionaries at the MTC. His message was simple. He asked a very stimulating question, “How does one recognize the Spirit?” \n “You will succeed as you learn to follow the Spirit, and, learn to understand the Holy Ghost and how He works. \n So, he said, How do YOU recognize the Spirit?\nThe answer is simple and direct. Now, listen carefully, he said. \n Quit stewing about it.\nQuit Fussing.\nQuit worrying.\nJust be good boys and girls. Just be worthy. \n Sometime you will look back and see that you were in the right place at the right time. And you will recognize that you were prompted and directed. \n I have seen so many wonderful people who are paralyzed by not having an immediate prompting to be guided. . . .NOW! Should I get married, should I go to school, should I buy this car, or should I do this thing? \n Most of us just need to press forward. Take that step in the dark, make that leap of faith.” \n I was raised in a home filled with music. My mother was a good pianist and my father was an untrained vocalist and drummer. Together, when they got on the dance floor, others would move aside to watch them “cut a rug”. \n My earliest musical memories are of sitting on the piano bench next to my mother as she played and I learned to sing the Primary Songs, and little folk songs of the day. She taught me the notes and I began to experiment with the piano. Some of my fondest musical memories are of playing piano duets with my mother. \n 1 \n In my pre-teen age years, Dad and I often worked together in our garden. Most mundane jobs were done to music. It had rhythm and tempo. Those important elements were used to advantage. Planting potatoes was accompanied by “I’ve been working on the railroad! Or, “Won’t You Come Home, Bill Bailey?” It was in this setting that I learned to harmonize. \n At age 12 Mom took me to the church and taught me how to turn on the Hammond organ and how to work the drawbars. In a few weeks I was called as the ward organist. When I was 16, my parents bought a Hammond Organ and I began private lessons with Gene Halliday in Ogden. At 18, I graduated from high school with a four year scholarship, a gold watch as outstanding musician, and had made a commercial organ recording. \n Immediately after graduation, my family moved to Northern California and I was hired by the Hammond Organ Company to demonstrate new models for dealers on the West coast. \n At 19, I was called to serve in the West Mexican Mission and came to the Language Training Mission at BYU for Spanish training. I dislocated my shoulder and had to go home for surgery. My mission was then transferred and I served in the Western States Mission, headquartered in Denver, Colorado. While there, I fell in a rather unkempt shower and tore the previous surgery apart. I went home for a second, more radical operation on my shoulder. Many weeks later, I returned to Denver. Baptisms were scarce in those years. My one experience was with Paul Rudolph, a Tlinket Indian . . . we call them Eskimos. I felt discouragement from my mission experience. Two major surgeries, some permanent disability and some “Oh woe is me” left me with the thought, “What a waist of time!” \n After my mission, I went to BYU as a music education major with organ as my instrument. My first experience was memorable. Professor JJ Keeler asked about my background. From that time on he called me Mr. Hammond. \n I soon discovered that my training on the Hammond Organ was not at all acceptable to the world of classical organists. One must have special shoes. One must sit “just so” on the bench. Classical organists write fingering, pedaling, phrasing, registration and piston numbers on their music. Precision and exactness, I soon learned, are far more important than digital dexterity, showiness, and improvisational skills. \n It was discouraging to say the least. I felt I had something to offer in the world of jazz and popular organ playing. But, I was at the bottom of the barrel when it came to the more churchly instrument. I felt something like the venerable May West, who is believed to have said, “I used to be Snow White, and then I drifted!” \n I left BYU for several years and developed a restaurant chain of three stores called Pipes and Pizza. It was a good business. One Sunday afternoon, I opened the Church News and saw a picture of Paul Rudolph. I could hardly believe my eyes. I opened to the article and read about his accomplishments. He was the son of the Tlinket Tribal Chief, who had died. As is the tribal custom, Paul had become the Tribal Chief. He had invited his people to learn about the church so that they would understand his religious beliefs. Several hundred people eventually joined and he had been called as the bishop. As a boy, he had learned to chant the genealogy of his people, since there was no written language. Through the efforts of wonderful people in Salt Lake, Paul was able to have his chant transcribed so that temple work could be completed for the people of his tribal ancestors. \n 2 \n All of a sudden, my missionary experience had become a success. I felt embarrassment for my rather immature attitude and asked the Lord’s forgiveness. I made a commitment right there and then that I would do everything I could to help prepare my children for missions. And, if one could serve the Spanish speaking people of the world, it might in some way vindicate what I had been unable to accomplish during my mission. \n “Just be good a boy and a good girl and someday you will look back and see that you were in the right place at the right time!” \n 1976 we sold our interest in the Utah stores, and moved to California to operate that business. \n One evening, a familiar voice was on the telephone. Newell Dayley said, “I will be in Los Angeles next week; can I come and visit with you?” He was kind. He asked about our family, our church service, our happiness. He asked if I had considered finishing my degree and opened my mind to other possibilities. My wife and I talked and prayed and fasted. I came back to BYU for one semester to complete my required California Teachers Certification. I returned home to teach music in the Ventura County School Systems. \n I loved teaching, but I was uncomfortable in the environment of fenced campuses, drug dealers, and budget cuts. After more prayer and soul searching, we sold our business and returned to BYU to graduate school. \n Many powerful experiences began unfolding in our lives. I was called to a bishopric and saw the Church from a very different perspective. \n I was privileged to serve as a guest organist at the Salt Lake Tabernacle. That was a treasured experience. The mixing of a unique building, the magnificent tonal pallet of the organ, and the feeling of reverence and awe that permeates ones soul; coupled together to create genuinely sacred moments. \n I was assigned to go to Jerusalem to inspect the Marcussen Pipe Organ installed in the BYU Center for Near Eastern Studies. While there, I was privileged to have some time alone sitting under a tree on the shores of the Sea of Galilee reading the New Testament. I read about the Savior’s walk on the water, and Peter’s dramatic attempt. I read about the Saviors call to the fisherman to “cast your nets on the other side.” I wondered if I might somehow be in the vicinity of these and other great miracles. Is it possible that the Savior might have been where I was then privileged to be? \n From over my shoulder came the sound of a voice. Abada, Abada, he called. I turned to see a Bedouin shepherd calling one of a small herd of sheep. Abada was easy to identify. Her tail perked up, her head raised from grazing, and she followed her master as he led her to the edge of the fresh water. There he knelt down beside her and washed her eyes and face and her rump. Then he carefully examined and cleaned each foot. After she had her fill of the fresh water, he wrapped his arms around her neck and petted her, and snuggled her, and spoke softly and lovingly to her. Then he stood, led her back to the fold, and called another. I watched with tenderness as he repeated the process over and over with each of the twelve or so sheep. \n I became witness to the Saviors instruction to “feed my sheep, feed my lambs”. \n 3 \n Soon after my return, I was called as bishop of my home ward. I quickly understood the lesson. Leave the ninety and nine, and go after the one. \n At my release as my home ward bishop after 6 1⁄2 years, I was called as a bishop on campus to a freshman ward. We sent out approximately 50 missionaries a semester. After 3 1⁄2 years I was released from that wonderful service. \n While serving as bishop our first son was called to serve a mission. I was full of great anticipation as that process unfolded. When his call came to Santiago, Chile, I was beside myself in joy. Tears flowed easily as I understood how much the Lord loved me, and answered my plea. When our second son received his call to Anaheim, California, Spanish, my gratitude was so deep and my heart so full, I could hardly speak. Our third child, a daughter, was then called to Santiago West, Chile. There are no words to express my feelings. I just looked at her letter and wept. Our fourth, another daughter, had been engaged to be married twice. She finally said, “Dad, I think I need to serve a mission, but I don’t want to learn a language, but instead want to learn a culture. I suggested that she needed to talk with her Heavenly Father, that I had nothing to do with such matters. Her plea was heard and she was called to Atlanta, Georgia. She was blessed with learning a culture. Each missionary served with spiritual awareness and humility. I was awakening to the power of the Spirit and the knowledge that He knows us and loves us and wants to help us. \n Quit worrying, quit stewing, and just be worthy! \n Another assignment came to serve in a BYU stake presidency with Newell Dayley. Our stake was comprised of single adults under 30. We sent many women on missions, and were privileged to witness hundreds of marriages in our years together. \n The MTC was our next adventure. We were called to serve in a Spanish Branch. Imagine, some 40- plus years after being called to serve in Mexico, to now be able to serve with those wonderful Latino missionaries. I knew the Lord had a plan for me. I was asked to play for Devotionals and accompany the missionaries to sing. No one sings with the joy and exuberance of 2500 committed missionaries as they belt out Called to Serve. \n In 2004 I was asked to go to Jerusalem again to work on the organ. I took my wife. On the way back we spent two weeks in London and 10 days in Sweden. For many years our family has been stopped in getting genealogy beyond my great-great grandfather. I felt prompted to take my genealogy and to see if someone could help. \n We flew to Stockholm. From Stockholm we drove 7 1⁄2 hours north to Harnosand; and then we drove 20 miles inland to Sabra and found the City Library that was for some unknown reason open on a holiday afternoon. It just happened that a young man about 25, was at the library and could speak English fluently. He helped us locate the cemetery and my great-grandfather’s grave and the family farm on a City map. He asked why we had come all this way. I told him that I was interested in genealogy and was trying to track down some information about my ancestors. That I had come to a dead end and thought I might find some clue if I came to the land of my heritage. This young man said he was very interested in genealogy and wanted to see my genealogy sheets. After a brief study of a few ancestral lines, he said, “I think some of your lines coincide with some of mine. Let me go home and get my genealogy and I will meet you at your hotel. \n 4 \n He provided us with links to new information and several hundred names for which we were able to complete the temple work. He also provided us with a book on the history of Sabra, Sweden, which included pictures, stories, accounts of importance, and yes, more genealogy. Consider the magnitude of that simple encounter just because of what I will describe as a step in the dark, a leap of faith, just pressing on! \n We feel that our steps have been guided.\nWe have felt the prompting of the Holy Ghost.\nWe have tried to be a good boy and a good girl.\nWe have tried to honor our covenants.\nWe feel that the Lord has guided us in our journey through life. \n I have been blessed with significant opportunities as an organist.\nTeaching music theory at BYU has been a most rewarding and satisfying journey. \n Serving in the councils of the Church has deepened my testimony. I know we are lead and guided by a prophet of God.\nFor 25 years I have served in the Executive Council of the School of Music. I have been personally involved in the recruiting, admission, scholarship awarding, teaching, and nurturing of hundreds if not thousands of wonderfully talented music students. What a significant blessing in my life. \n I have seen my four children serve honorable missions, marry in a temple, and I can now extend my arms to15 grandchildren. \n Like the saints of an earlier time, we have learned that: \n The Lord is extending the Saint’s understanding, Restoring their judges and all as at first.\nThe knowledge and power of God are expanding; The veil o’er the earth is beginning to burst.\nWe’ll sing and we’ll shout with the armies of heaven, Hosanna, hosanna to God and the Lamb! \n Let glory to them in the highest be given, Hence forth and forever, Amen and amen! \n In the name of Jesus Christ, amen. \n Consider Music \n Keynote Address given on August 2, 2011\nMadsen Recital Hall, Harris Fine Arts Center BYU Organ Workshop\nJeremy B. King\nThe Neal A. Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship Brigham Young University \n Good morning and welcome to the campus of Brigham Young University, it’s a pleasure for me to meet with you for a few minutes this morning. As I stand here, I suppose that I am surrounded by a group of very talented musicians. I don’t think I exaggerate by saying that I am not musically gifted. I wonder what I can say or offer this group that might be worthwhile for you to hear. I hope I can share my appreciation for what you do to brighten the lives of those who hear the music you create. I’ve come to learn that understanding another human being, and seeing things from another’s perspective is a very difficult thing to do. Perhaps in the next few minutes I can give you a glimpse of what music means to me, and so many like me who, although we don’t create beautiful music, find deep spiritual meaning and significance in listening to the music created and played by others. I don’t think of myself as a victim, but there are at least two things that seem out to get me: (1) horses and (2) musical instruments. There’s no need to tell you about the half a dozen ill-fated horse experiences. But I will mention the handful of attempts I’ve made to learn a musical instrument, all of which have ended badly. Let me give a little background. Playing a musical instrument was always a goal of mine. As a middle-school -aged youth I thought the coolest instrument of all was the bagpipes. Perhaps all of you organ players are thinking I at least had the “pipes” part correct. I imagined myself playing the bagpipes at the front of parades, school assemblies, and maybe the occasional funeral in Scotland. But it wasn’t to be. For one thing, I grew up in a small town with a small school. We had a band, but we didn’t have an orchestra…no strings…we just had brass, woodwind and percussion…certainly no bagpipes. Even now, after moving away from a small town I don’t see bagpipes around. What section would a bagpipe be a part of anyway? Maybe we should add an “awesome” section? Since I couldn’t even find a store that sold bagpipes in Payette, Idaho, I decided to settle for the clarinet. I didn’t last long with the clarinet before I switched to the much flashier trombone. It was with my trusty trombone in hand that I received my first and only “F” in an academic subject. That F might as well have stood for “Final” because I gave up on playing an instrument for good. I don’t suppose many of you can empathize with me on this point…after all, who flunks out of band? Perhaps I lacked the patience, or just didn’t practice enough. In the end, though, I think it came down to talent and effort, and I felt both were lacking in my case. Although I’ve never mastered an instrument, or found myself to be a musician, let me share with you a quality concerning music that I do have. That is the quality of loving and appreciating beautiful music. I am currently serving as a Bishop for my church (Latter Day Saint). As a leader in my congregation I am often presiding in meetings I attend. During my time as Bishop I’ve actively encouraged music as a form of worship and renewal. Recently, it’s come to my attention that I have a reputation for being “pro-music”. I laughed a little bit when I was told that for the first time. Honestly it’s hard for me to imagine someone who is not pro-music…To me being against music would be like being against friendship or light…..although there is a lot of noise out in the world masquerading as music. I think what is meant in this case by being promusic is a proactive desire to include music and more music in our worship services.. Since the meetings are under my direction, I have the chance to influence a bit of what goes on out there. Thanks to some gifted musicians, who are willing to share their talents, we’ve had some really great music. We’ve enjoyed vocal solos, organ solos, duets, beautiful choir pieces, and lots and lots of congregational hymns accompanied by the organ. On, Easter Sunday this year we closed our meeting by singing two hymns in medley fashion. The organ sounded out with power and passion, and it seemed to me that the earth itself was joining in the song. We often begin and end our meetings with music because of the tone it sets. Just last month one member of my congregation was so touched by the prelude music she approached me and expressed her appreciation for the beautiful music, “I really needed that” she said. Almost without fail following a special musical number the speaker who follows will say something like, “we should just end the meeting now” or “ I wish they could just keep singing.” It is my firm belief that music touches us in ways that nothing else can. The same person who can sit through a sermon completely unmoved will be brought to tears by music. In my congregation we have many, many, little children and new born infants. When things line up just right, we really create quite a ruckus, you know, things get really loud. I am so grateful when the music portion of the program comes, not only does it drown out some of that noise, it actually calms down the children. I’ve witnessed this first hand with my little daughter. Children often stop playing or crying and look towards the source of the music. What a wonderful testimony that is about the power of music to touch our soul. Even from the earliest ages of our life our spirits understand music and feel its influence. We live in a world of clutter and noise. We live in a world of distraction. There is a counterfeit to virtually everything that is good and noble. Music is no exception. So much of what claims to be music is nothing more than noise, and in some cases is quite spiritually destructive. Sometimes we underestimate the effect of good music. Likewise, we may not recognize how harmful bad music can be. In this “the age of information” with virtually every book and song at our fingertips, we need ambassadors who promote and create and perform the very best of music. I believe this group qualifies as part of that group. I expect all of you promote music that edifies and enlarges the soul, music that brings a measure of peace, or strengthens us in our convictions. Consider the power of music. Is it any wonder that parents sing their children lullaby’s before they go to bed? After a bad dream parents may even sing themselves a lullaby. When an unclean thought enters our mind, we may use music to drive it away. In the dark corners of my life, I have found music to be a light that pierces through the darkness and reminds me of a better place. We are all wanderers in a strange land, far from home. And although we are far from our heavenly home, we are privileged to speak one of the languages of Heaven, that of sacred music. I need music. I need music to soothe my soul and calm my children. I need those who are willing to create good music, or who perform music created by others. Of all the arts, music is so re-creatable. The great works of the masters can be performed today just as they were hundreds of years ago. Those who perform these great pieces actually create them for me, and I feel as if I am hearing Bach or Mozart or sacred hymns for the first time. I wonder if there are any here who don’t feel appreciated. Perhaps you practice and prepare and then feel like no one is listening. Perhaps you feel like some aren’t paying attention, or worse yet, there may be some who speak and interrupt you. I know there are times when I’ve spoken in church when I wonder if anyone at all is paying attention. I believe that many are listening, and that even those who aren’t paying reverent attention benefit from the atmosphere you create. I mentioned earlier the example of prelude music. Even with beautiful prelude music there are some who continue to make noise or distraction. But it is much better than it otherwise would be. Have you ever been guilty of playing the wrong note? There may be the occasional person who scoffs because the wrong note was played, but there are always some who mock. I suppose there are times when efforts go unnoticed and unappreciated. There is great value in persevering even when it goes unnoticed. When I was in high school I was fascinated by dog sledding. I read books and watched documentaries about the sport. I planned to one day compete in the 1,000 mile Iditarod dog sled race in Alaska. Even though I didn’t have a dog, I decided to charter a club. After doing some paperwork, I was the inaugural member of the Payette High School Dog Sledding Club. Anyone could join, but people with dogs were preferred. People with larger dogs, especially Malamutes and Huskies were preferred even more. I made plans to construct my own dog sled and started training (and by training I mean I jogged and got in better physical shape). I coerced a couple of my friends into joining. As I recall, one of them owned a Chihuahua, and the other owned two black labs. The Chihuahua was so small that his whole body would fit through just one of the holes in a dog sled harness, so Bo (the Chihuahua was named Bo) was mostly a symbolic member of the team. The other two dogs, black labs (one of which was named Bear) were big enough, but my friends dad wouldn’t let us use them for practice. No one with suitable dogs ever joined that dog sledding club. Since we didn’t have any dogs the sled never got built. I laugh at it now; my poor little club, my dog-sledding club, had neither dogs nor sleds. Wouldn’t that be like an organ solo without an organ? To my knowledge no one has ever attempted to re-charter the club after that first year. By almost every measure available to humankind that dog sledding club was a failure. Since we had no funding, we didn’t even have a “going out of business “ party. I mention this story for a reason. (I figured you’d be getting bored of me by this point in my talk and I needed a good funny story to wake you up). But let me draw a point from this…… I doubt the dog-sledding club ever did anything for my friends, but it was good for me. In my attempt to create something good, I became a better person. I learned and studied and genuinely enjoyed the experience (with the exception of not finding any suitable dogs). You’d have to be a pretty poor musician to fail as miserably in your musical pursuits as I did in my dog-sledding pursuits, but you’d still be a better person for having made the effort? Some efforts don’t yield the results we expect, but there is great value in persevering even when it goes unnoticed. By the way, I am no longer assembling a dog sled team, so please don’t offer me your stray dogs to me after the meeting. A powerful story is told of music finding a foothold in the hearts of men even during a time of war. During the winter of 1914, about 100,000 World War I troops were involved in an unofficial ceasefire. It began, by German soldiers putting up some candles and Christmas decorations around their trenches. The soldiers continued the celebration by singing Christmas carols. The British responded by singing carols of their own. The two sides continued by shouting Christmas greetings to one another and more singing. Soon thereafter there were excursions across no-man’s land, where small gifts were exchanged. The truce also allowed for a period of peace so recently fallen soldiers could be brought back behind their lines for burial. In many sectors the truce lasted through Christmas night and in some places until New Years Day. What an unlikely “Silent Night” that must have been. I realize we are in the very heat of summer now, but when I think about what music mean’s to me I can’t help but make another reference to Christmas music. I love Christmas music. I find it to be joyful and uplifting. One of my best memories as a youth is that of riding on a trailer full of hay along the dark and empty streets in my hometown and singing Christmas Carols. People would come out of their homes as we passed by and listen to the songs. One of those carols, and one of my favorites is “I heard the Bell’s on Christmas Day”. It says in part, “In despair, I bowed my head, there is no peace on earth I said, for Hate is strong and mocks the song of peace on earth goodwill to men……then peeled the bells more loud and deep, “God is not dead nor doth he sleep, the wrong shall fail, the right prevail with peace on earth goodwill to men.” May we be like those bells, ringing out, for all to hear who will hear. Never in the history of the world has music been more important because of its unique ability to reach the hearts of us all and touch us for good. I am anxiously looking forward to the upcoming Christmas season. As a congregation we are planning to go Christmas caroling. We will sing together out in the streets of Provo. We’ll stop by the homes of the elderly, the sick, or the downtrodden. I know the power beautiful music has to “lift the hands that hang down”. And there are so many hands that hang down. We are a better people and a better world because of music and those who share their musical talents with us. I know I am in a group of musically talented people today. Many of you have served for years in different capacities relating to music, and the organ. Please keep preparing ,and serving and sharing your gift with me and others like me. We need you. I know that many of you are involved in the music for religious congregations. I’d like to suggest how music may become a more important and appreciated part of your meetings: Break out of the routine. Sometimes when we do the same things again and again, in the same order, we get into a routine. Routines can be good, there is great power of consistency that comes from establishing a pattern, but routine often leads to complacency and lead us to take something for granted. Some of the things we’ve done in my congregation to break out of our routine include mixing up the order and frequency of musical selections. We may have one intermediate hymn or a choir selection, or one of each. When we sing a song we sing all verses, not just the main verses printed next to the music but the additional verses listed at the end, we don’t cut our songs short for expediency. Even when we are running late, we sing the entire hymn. We have a variety of music and use a good mix of old favorites and new pieces. We ask many to participate. Our youth and children sing. Some of our meetings consist almost exclusively of music such as our Easter Sunday or Christmas program. Perhaps one of the best things we’ve done to break the routine was to have two closing hymns on Easter Sunday. Doesn’t that say, “We aren’t just singing to close the meeting because that is what we do…we are singing because music belongs here….it’s Easter…let’s worship the Lord in song.” We’ve talked today about the great power music has to edify and enlarge our souls. We recognize that so much music, especially sacred music, has great power to strengthen us spiritually and fortify our convictions. As a non-musician who admittedly doesn’t understand how much effort it must take, “thank you for your efforts”. I’m grateful to you for developing your talents and for your willingness to share your talent. I hope you have a wonderful conference. I’m sure you’ll be edified and enlarged by the things you hear and learn over the next several days. May you take that edification and share it in whatever capacity you can. Let us find hope through music. Like us be like those wonderful Christmas bells that go “Ringing, Singing, on their way….A voice, a chime, a chant sublime of Peace on Earth, good will to men.” \n Robert Cundick \n 2013 \n  I am honored to address you today as the keynote speaker at this annual BYU Organ Workshop. This event continues to be a superb source of information and inspiration for all participants.  \n  I was very surprised when Don Cook invited me to speak as I do not accept speaking or performance requests because of my physical condition. The spirit falters and the flesh continues to weaken. The only exception is an occasional special funeral, such as my close friend Beverley Sorenson’s. I had previously played for her husband Jim’s services. The very large congregation was filled with luminaries from throughout the state. I selected the simplest organ music possible and played it very slowly. I felt that I myself was not far from being in a coffin and I’m sure that the listeners agreed.  \n  I’m now almost 87 years of age. I am the oldest living Temple Square organist as well as the oldest living Tabernacle choir organist. Thus, I have lived and experienced a long period of continuing evolution in the music of the Restored Church as it strives to meet the complex needs of a now world-wide presence. Let me share some of my singular musical experiences both past and present.  \n  I started “in the trenches” so to speak when a new Hammond model A electronic organ arrived at our Sandy 2nd ward. It replaced our old hand-pumped reed organ. “This is the instrument of the future”, the salesman confidently proclaimed. “Pipe organs will be obsolete in ten years”. I was fascinated by the sound which could be synthesized in seemingly endless variety by means of the drawbars. I promptly enrolled in a General Music Committee sponsored 12 week course for beginning organists. Upon the completion, I was called to be a Sunday School organist. I was twelve years old at the time. In those days, organ and even vocal music was performed during the passing of the sacrament. Among other ear-pleasing pieces, I often naively played “Hymn of the Nuns”. (This was during World War ll.) I remember attending a neighboring ward and hearing “Comin’ in on a wing and a prayer. (Tho’ there’s one engine gone, we will still carry on, comin’ in on a wing and a prayer”). Shortly thereafter, the Church abolished all sacramental music. While I was initially shocked, I soon realized that this was an inspired change. Thereafter I have continued to treasure this time in our services when we can contemplate the true meaning of the sacrament in complete (or almost complete) quiet. How I wish that this was the case during the organ prelude as well.  \n  We sang the songs in Deseret Sunday School Songs published by The Deseret Sunday School Union. “Count Your Many blessings”, “Did You Think to Pray” and “Dear to the Heart of the Shepherd” were among the favorites. These songs were beloved by the General Authorities. Though they were omitted in later publications, they reappeared in our latest hymnal due to the desire of these elderly brethren. They are now often curiously referred to as “Hymns of the Restoration”.  \n  To be prepared for every Sunday School song practice, I spent an entire summer learning to play all of these songs. I would start with the first page and proceed to play each song at a moderate tempo without stopping. I would continue to play each successive song in the same manner until 1 finished the last page of the book. It was a grueling task but at the end of the summer I could confidently play any of these songs at the correct tempo without mistakes. As a result I found that I could sight-read most music. This skill has proved to be invaluable throughout my entire career.  \n  After several years of private lessons, my teacher felt that I should study with Alexander Schreiner. Neither my parents or I could afford his very high lesson fees during these Great Depression times. Fortunately, Schreiner accepted me as his only scholarship student.  \n  At the same time I met my wonderful high school music teacher, Donald Olsen. A BYU graduate, he was a fine violinist and a former student of Leroy J. Robertson. He showed me a manuscript copy of The Lord’s Prayer. The heavens opened. I was overwhelmed by its glorious sound. This encounter later proved to be a turning point in my life when 1 entered the U. of U. \n  After high school in 1945, I served in the Merchant Marine for two years. Following my release, I enrolled at the U. of U. as a freshman music major. Since my service was not included in the GI Bill of Rights, I didn’t receive any financial assistance. I continued to be self-supporting, as 1 had been since high school days. In addition to teaching piano and organ lessons, I played piano in jazz bands.  \n  One of my organ students was Charlotte Ann Clark. She lived just a block away. She was 16 years old. I was 4 years older, but we had much in common. We belonged to the same ward (Sandy 2nd) and had attended the same high school (Jordan High). Moreover, we were both friends and faithful and fully committed Mormons. Mutual admiration slowly became deepest love and she accepted my engagement ring. When she excitedly showed it to her parents, her father asked, ”How will he support you?”. She confidently replied, “He’s a musician!”. Her father retorted, “I repeat the question, how will he support you?”  \n  We were married in the Manti Temple. We bought a small home at 424 Douglas Street, very close to the U. campus. I continued my studies while teaching dozens of beginning GI piano students in the U. of U. music department serving as organist at other churches such as 1st Unitarian and United Methodist on Sundays, plus Temple B’nai Israel on Friday nights and Christian Scientist mid-week, to earn a few extra dollars. I was Maurice Abravanel’s rehearsal pianist. This was all in addition to being a full-time student and loving husband and father. I did, indeed, support my wife and children very well, much to my father-in-law’s amazement. In retrospect I can appreciate his concern for his wonderful daughter. She truly is one-of-a-kind. Without her, I never could have succeeded. My greatest blessing is our eternal marriage. We now have 5 children, 23 grandchildren and 33 great-grandchildren.  \n  As a student at the U. of U. I finally met Leroy Robertson. In his graduate Bach to Contemporary class, he taught me to compose music for the first time in my life. Robertson was a superb teacher. This wonderful internationally famous composer was amazed at the maturity of Three Preludes and Fugues Tor Piano, which was my first work. Under Robertson’s constant inspiration and encouragement, I never looked back. I have continued to compose ever since. I have also stayed in close contact with the family since his death. I continue to make every effort to perpetuate his name and his priceless legacy.  \n  After graduation, we moved to Provo where I taught music theory at BYU. Five years later President David O. McKay called me and my family to England where I was to serve my first mission as organist at the new Hyde Park Chapel in London. One hectic week after our call we arrived to replace Roy Darley, who immediately left to return to Temple Square to resume his work as Assistant Tabernacle Organist.  \n  But where to begin? I hadn’t played the organ since we left Salt Lake, except to serve as organist in the Oak Hills 2nd Ward. All I had was a briefcase full of music. I was to play my first recital two days later and continue to play daily recitals 6 days each week. Other professional organists would ask, ”How can you possibly play six different recitals each week without breaking down?” To my consternation, our English ward and branch members would ask, ”ls that all you do?  \n  I began by contacting Robert Munns, who was organist at nearby Holy Trinity Church. He came to my rescue. He taught me appropriate new repertoire and explained British organ design and registration. With almost constant practice and a wonderful patient wife and family, I managed to cope with this formidable challenge. Alexander Schreiner had dedicated the organ and played the initial recitals. He had set a high standard. I felt that I would be on constant trial before a potential audience of world-famed musicians. I was only able to succeed with the constant help of the Lord. Equal amounts of prayer and careful practice was the final answer. \n  Among many wonderful experiences, I will mention just two: \n  The first was playing a recital at King’s College, Cambridge. My wife thought of King Henry VIII while I practiced in this silent dark, historic chapel. I was awed by the sound of this superb instrument. We were there as Francis Jackson’s guests. It was a singular feeling.  \n  The second was playing the organ accompaniment for Zoltan Kodaly’s Missa Brevis at St. Paul’s Cathedral in London. Robert Munns conducted his Holy Trinity Choir. Ralph Downes was scheduled as organist but was suddenly needed elsewhere. Robert asked me to deputize, or as we would say, “substitute” for Downes. The reverberation time was enormous. The console is located high above on the central screen. It is reached by a winding staircase. When I was rehearsing before hand, I played and abruptly released a single chord, quickly slid off the bench and raced down the stairs to stand in the center of the nave below. The chord was still sounding! “Use the dome trumpet as sparingly as possible”, I had been warned. “We’re afraid that it could crack the dome”. I had to use it for the final chord of the Kodaly. I could just imagine the possible world headlines: “Mormon organist destroys the dome at St. Paul’s Cathedral”.  \n  After our English mission, we returned to Provo where I resumed teaching at BYU. A year later, another call dramatically changed our lives. I was teaching a counterpoint class. A secretary threw the door open and excitedly shout, ”You must call the office of the First Presidency!” I ran to the phone and returned the call. I was told to come to Pres. Hugh B. Brown’s office immediately. When I arrived he told me that Frank Asper would retire. I was to be his replacement but I could only tell my wife until I was sustained at General Conference. Speculation on campus was rampant. I only could say that I wouldn’t be excommunicated or called on a another mission. I could say nothing more, I was certain of just one thing l would retire at age 65.  \n  As my close friend, the late Edward L. Hart wrote: “The past returns, the springs of time unwind, and all is present in the heart and mind”. So it is at this moment. I have shared my memory and feelings of these past events. In my mind’s eye, they are as vivid and real as if they had just occurred.  \n  The Tabernacle organ bench is a never-ending hot seat. The pressure of the work is unrelenting. In addition to live broadcasts, organ recitals, intensive organ practice and trying to be a good husband and father, I was executive head of the Church Music Dept. under Alexander Schreiner as chairman. As such, I designed and printed the Guidebook for Organists and assigned Ralph Woodward to write a Guidebook for Conductors and others to write similar guidebooks.  \n  I also managed to persuade the Primary and Sunday School organizations to agree upon the contents of a new children’s songbook. It was titled Sing With Me. I composed two new songs and invited such composers as Reid Nibley, Gaylen Hatton, Newell K. Brown, Jay Welch Merrill Bradshaw, Crawford Gates and others to contribute. I included songs from previous songbooks by both organizations. Finally. I carefully copied the entire contents in pencil manuscript for the printer.  \n  When Alexander Schreiner retired I was now the head organist. I chose John Longhurst as Schreiner’s replacement. John became my closest friend and confidant.  \n  I was privileged to work with some great men at the Tabernacle: Alexander Schreiner, Richard P. Condie, Jay Welch and Jerold Ottley. My happiest time was with Jerry. When Jerry became the conductor, we were able Io work together as a team conductors, organists and business manager. Although we have all retired, we still meet with these friends and their wives once a month. We are a closely-knit group. We call ourselves “The Emeritabs”.  \n  I had many friends and no known enemies among the General Authorities. Many called me “Bob”, rather than”Robert” or “Brother Cundick”. During our mission in England, Mark E. Petersen and N. Eldon Tanner became our close friends. Upon our return, both these and other General Authority doors were always open to me. Thus, the various worthy projects that John and I undertook had every chance for success.  \n  Among these are the procurement of the Robert Sipe tracker action organ, basement practice organs, harpsichords and Steinway pianos in the Assembly Hall. The only problem was that 1 personally had to raise the purchase money, which I did. John and I were so involved in the design of the remodeled building We also were responsible for procuring the necessary First Presidency approval for the rebuilding of the Tabernacle Organ by the Schoenstein Company, and the Casavant Organ in the Joseph Smith building.  \n  We initiated the guest organist program and received permission for the appointment of Bonnie Goodliffe and Linda Margetts as Temple Square Organists. They became the first women to hold such a position since Katherine Romney Stewart in 1900. We felt that such a change was long overdue.  \n  In the year 1991 as I had previously vowed, I retired as I was now 65 years of age. Pres. Howard W, Hunter had earlier asked us to serve as hosts at the BYU Jerusalem Center. Nov. 30th was my last day at the Tabernacle. On Pearl Harbor Day, Dec. 7th, just one week later we landed at Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv. From there we were driven up to the beautiful BYU Jerusalem Center on Mt. Scopus.  \n  Our assignment was to change the public perception of the Center from mistrust to complete trust and appreciation. This we accomplished by improving the hosting procedure and starting a new concert series. The Iron Curtain had now fallen, the USSR had now allowed Russian Jews to leave. Superb new Jewish musicians from Russia were arriving by the plane load almost daily. It seemed that everyone getting off the planes carried an instrument case. The saying was: “If they don’t carry a musical instrument case, it’s because they are a pianist”. As the musical job market was saturated, they were forced to accept menial work in order to survive. We featured them on the series, much to the native Israeli’s appreciation. Soon, every fine Jewish musician wanted to appear in concert at the center. We gained the sponsorship of the national music network, Kol Israel, the Jerusalem Rubin Academy of Music and the Jerusalem Symphony. These concerts have continued to be held to this day, even when BYU did not have students at the center. Visitor attendance grew from 9,000 per year to 70,000 when we left.  \n  I was also the catalyst to bring the Tabernacle choir to Israel. Their splendid concerts did much to bolster the Church’s image in Israel.  \n  We knew that we had accomplished our assignment when, just before we left, we were standing in a line at the Israel Museum. We heard a fine jewelry-loaded Jewish woman ask her obviously equally wealthy Jewish companion, “My dear, have you a«ended the marvelous concerts at our Jerusalem Center? If not, you must!” Her choice of the pronoun “our” was most gratifying. We wanted to cheer aloud!  \n  Richard Condie used to say, ”Good Mormons have ants in their pants”, meaning that they are “anxiously engaged in a good cause”. Your attendance here today is indeed proof of your commitment to organ excellence.  \n  I thank you very much for your kind attention. \n Jerry L. Jaccard, EdD\nBYU School of Music\n2014 \n Introduction \n Thank, you Brother Cook, for this special opportunity to share some thoughts with fellow musicians of the Church. When Brother Cook invited me to give this keynote, he mentioned the possibility of also sharing some of my experiences with our late brother, Doug Bush. Therefore, I would like to dedicate this talk to the memory of Douglas Earl Bush. Doug was one of my very best friends; we drove all over Europe together sharing favorite places with each other while also working on our research projects. We teased each other that between us, we were all too well acquainted with every pastry and chocolate shop between Amsterdam and Budapest. Doug served a mission in German- speaking Switzerland, and I am of French-speaking Swiss ancestry, so we were both hopelessly in love with all things Swiss. However, he was not acquainted with Swiss chocolate from the French cantons, so that gave me an opportunity to expand his already considerable palette of options. From then on, he always brought back to me from his trips a few delectables made by the company where one of my Jaccard cousins had worked before retiring. \n Doug had never been to Hungary where I have been researching their wonderful and highly developed national music education system since 1980. So, my wife Alta and I arranged to meet him one day about 10 years ago at the main train station in Budapest, where he would be arriving from Vienna. We had already warned him about the over- eager (and sometimes aggressive) taxi drivers in case we were late. In what was surely the Lord’s perfect timing, Doug stepped out of the station just as we made our first circuit around the parking lot. I threw his suitcases into the trunk, he climbed into the back seat and we were off on our wild adventure. I noticed that he was carefully holding a cake- sized pastry box by the top strings and instinctively knew that chocolate would soon be involved. Our first stop was the Bulgarian Culture House where we would spend the first night. As soon as we installed Doug in his room, he invited us to sit on the edge of his bed and opened up the box to reveal a Sacher Torte fresh from Vienna. He divvied it up, and we polished it off like the three little pigs. \n The next day, as we drove deep into the interior of Hungary, Doug would tell us to stop at what seemed like every other gas station to treat us to a Magnum ice cream bar. We must have eaten at least four apiece that afternoon. Alta and I later reflected that it was his way of thanking us for taking him around Hungary to scout out the possibility of his doing a future organ performance tour there. Alta and Doug both grew up on ranches, she in Arizona and he in Montana, so they understood each other perfectly and I was always the fall guy for their hilarious ranch stories. All it took was the sighting of a single cow to set them off again. We basically ate, laughed and giggled our way through the Hungarian countryside. \n However, as many of you know, there was much more to Doug than food, chocolate and his devastating wit (we couldn’t sit anywhere near each other in BYU faculty meetings). He also loved people, especially his students. We shared many students and what struck me the most was his acceptance of students with a wide range of abilities; he was as concerned with raising amateurs as well as professionals. I believe Doug never forgot his own humble journey from a less than musical rural atmosphere to the great musician, composer and teacher he became. The rest of my remarks today are intended to convey that attitude and spirit. It is perhaps the best way I can honor him and pass the baton to you and all those you will edify and teach in your homes, wards and stakes. \n Talent Myth \n From my vantage point as a teacher of music teachers, I find that “talent” is one of the most misused words in our vocabularly. It seems that almost every person in our national society equates the Savior’s use of “talents” with the ability to perform something. However, in His context, it is clear that He is talking about opportunities for growth. The unprofitable servant was chastized not because he wasn’t capable, but because he did not seize the opportunity to become more capable. Understanding the matter of talent this way profoundly changes how we should think about whether or not people are “musical.” For my part, I boldly tell you that all of us are born musical; hundreds of my colleagues around the world agree with me. So, it becomes a matter of education, serious lifelong education, not haphazard or unsubstantial “tone baths” as one of my early mentors called it.1 \n I home teach two wonderful sisters who have a sign prominently displayed for all visitors to see upon entering their humble home. It reads: “Comparison is the thief of joy.” Nothing could apply more perfectly to the world of musicians! The first great truth of music making is that there will always be someone who sings or plays better than you. Admit it, get over it, celebrate their accomplishments and enjoy yours. They are not truly artists if they give the slightest hint of disdain toward you, and you are not a true artist if you think you are superior to those of lesser musical prowess. The Zion standard for musicians must surely be one of mutual encouragement and cooperation as we build each other. The scriptural record teaches us that Zion will be a cooperative rather than a competitive endeavor. \n The other great truth of music is that no matter how good we may be now or in the future, we all pale in comparison to the immense mountain we musicians choose to climb, that vast ever-growing body of literature called Music. I have always loved how Belgian-Swiss music psychologist Edgar Willems characterized our dilemma: \n Bad musicians cannot hear what they are playing; Mediocre ones could hear it, but they don’t listen; Average musicians hear what they just played;\nOnly good musicians hear what they are going to play.2 \n In brief, music requires lifelong learning, whether at the professional, amateur or church calling level. It requires developing a careful balance among heart, head, ears and hands, in that order. We too often begin at the wrong end of that journey. \n We are not great musicians just because we say we are, what I call “The Aïda Complex.” We lived back East for several years and at one point in time, a sister moved into our ward and announced that she was an opera singer. She was what Doug Bush would have called “one spicy meatball.” I happened to know from being on the Stake High Council and having heard her sing in another ward, that she thought she was an opera singer. She had the presence, she had the sound, but she did not have the ear. Unfortunately and inexplicably, bishop after bishop called her to be the ward music chairperson, which literally kept her from growing in the ways that other non-musical callings would provide for her. From that position of authority, she made sure that she sang in church once a month. Moreover, she sang opera arias slightly out of tune and loud enough to peel the paint off the walls. After a few months of this, a young child gave voice to what everyone was thinking in a scene that I shall never forget. The sister made her usual grand entrance from the back row up to the stand, tossing her thick mane of beautiful hair. Just as she started up the aisle, four-year-old Todd caught sight of her, stood up on the pew and loudly cried “Oh, no!” All of the adults immediately stuffed their fists in their mouths and their head between their legs. The whole congregation was a sea of heaving backs trying with all their might to maintain some sense of decorum. She was stunningly oblivious to the scene before her. Would you believe that it all happened again a month later, except that Todd’s mother reached up and grabbed him just as he said “Oh, no!” and when she pulled him down he whacked his forehead on the back of the pew, sounding like a rifle shot? He began to wail, and the tragic comedy of it all once again put the congregation nearly convulsing under their pews. She blithely sang through it all. \n I came to understand that this dear misguided and unfortunately enabled sister was suffering from a sort of musical sickness in which her self worth was bound to her own misconception of music. That realization was only the beginning of my own sorrows because I was soon called to be the ward choir director. She came habitually late to rehearsals and insisted on singing with her opera voice. I finally had to do something about it to avoid driving away the rest of the choir members. So after much thought, prayer, and practicing the right tone of voice, I finally mustered up the courage to say, “Sister, would you please be so kind as to use your choir voice.” Her response was, “Oh no, I can’t do that because my voice has been trained.” And so while you are here this week to seek “training” in organ playing, please remember that music is something we do with people, not to them. It should not be an affliction we visit upon those within our spheres of influence. \n Now, please be aware that as organists, you play the biggest, potentially loudest instrument on earth. Please do all you can to make sure that the little Todds of the Church will not cry out in anguish, “Oh, no!” when you begin to play. Church service playing, including preludes and postludes, are not recitals. One of my favorite local high school choral directors once told me of being on tour with their university choir in a resort town in another country. While they were walking down the main street together looking in the shop windows late at night one of their singers who was notorious for being the resident diva (another “spicy meatball”) shouted, “Look, it says GO Diva!” They were stunned to see that she was pointing to a display of Godiva chocolates, then stunned again when they realized she really didn’t know! The Church does not need divas or divos of any sort, but humble musicians who know the true place of music in the sacrament service. \n Elder Kevin S. Hamilton of the Seventy indirectly spoke about the true function of music in the sacrament meeting in his October 2013 conference talk: “Each week we have the opportunity to attend a sacrament meeting, where we can renew these covenants by partaking of the bread and water of the sacrament ordinance . . . God’s promise to us in return is His Spirit as a guide and protection.” Continuing on he says, “We renew our covenants, receive an increased measure of the Spirit, and have the additional blessing of being instructed and edified by the Holy Ghost.”3 In other words, all of our playing of prelude music and the accompanying and singing of hymns must help the congregation approach the ordinance of the sacrament in the utmost reverence while also inviting the Spirit to attend. \n Nothing could be clearer. Please work with your choristers to agree on tempi, staying within the range of beats per minute as indicated in the Hymnal. Please chose prelude and postlude pieces that invite and retain the Spirit rather than displaying your technically virtuosity. To play lyrically, softly and in a subdued, quiet way requires a different kind of virtuosity rooted in your own spirituality. Mastering the art of registration on the particular organ in your chapel goes a long way toward providing spiritually conducive music. If you respect the music, then others will also and many of the musical problems we experience in wards will disappear. Take the music seriously, yourselves not so much! \n As if the “Aïda Complex” episodes in our ward out East were not enough, the new bishop was also an organist. Up until his arrival, we had enjoyed the soft, reverent music of our three very fine ward organists, any two of whom occasionally played wonderful organ-piano duet hymn arrangements for special musical numbers. But this highly competitive bishop wanted everyone to know that he was a “classically trained” organist and to my horror, dismissed the three from playing the postludes so that he could play them, which he choose to be the great Bach preludes and fugues at full blast. The congregation fled from the chapel and so began the habit of “fellowshipping in the halls” instead of going straight to Sunday School classes. I tried to talk to him about it, but he disdained what he perceived to be the inferior talents of the other three, harking back to what I said at the beginning of this talk. As one who believes in the innate musicality of all mankind, I was greatly saddened by his attitude. \n Now Here Comes Something More Than Music \n Music is a powerful force pervading the Universe. In the 1970’s, the NASA Voyager missions transmitted back to Earth musical sounds seemingly organized like compositions as emitted by the magnetospheres of the planets of our solar system, their moons and their interactions with the solar wind. But music also fills our inner universe, that of our souls. One of my dearest colleagues is a masterful musician, Gabriella Thész, the former director of the world reknown Hungarian Radio Children’s Choir who now directs the Children’s Choir of the Hungarian National Philharmonic. She once told me in a recorded interview: \n Part rehearsals are very intimate. I can sit down and talk to them and I can tell them so many times just little things in comparison to the music. Not only pure intonation, because if their soul is okay, they will be singing much differently. Now, this Bartók piece for example, Párnás Tancdal, is philosophical and here comes something more than music, because this is about life. The main idea is to form their personality through their soul [and] their sensitivity, and that means they become different people through music. So the music helps me talk to them. The music is the instrument I’m using to change them [and] to give ideas [to them] from people like composers. Music doesn’t give you words—music gives you more, it changes the soul. I teach them how to speak the language of music, and actually, we form their spirit, their soul, their mind, their whole personality. It’s part of the work, which belongs to the art [of music]. So art forms people and we would not be able to live without art.4 (edited for clarity and continuity, emphases added) \n Find the Balance \n As organists, you may be wondering why I keep talking about singers, singing and choirs. Well, it’s because singing is how the vast majority of Church members make music during Church services. Your calling is to accompany them, but as you already know, you often find yourselves in the position of enlightening and teaching them, an aspect of your calling which will require much tender Christlike nurturing, patience and diplomacy. Albert Lavignac, one of the great musical minds of the Paris Conservatory and Debussy’s teacher once wrote: “He/she who is only a pianist is not a good pianist.” In other words, you must have a multi-dimensional life, because your music can only reflect the richness of your life or the lack thereof. All good organists know that they should also \n be able to conduct, to rehearse, and to sing. These are the tools they have through which to help others give public utterance to the Spirit during times of worship. \n I also encourage you to have frequent, long and deep talks with yourself about your own life, the musical part of it and all of its other dimensions. President David O. McKay often taught the importance of personal and prayerful meditation. Use these times to check up on whether you are balanced. Are you so consumed by your passion for music that you are telling the Lord and His local Church leaders what callings you should have? Do you have the faith and courage to open yourself up to other callings through which, as in the Parable of Talents, you can seize opportunities to grow in other directions and dimensions? If you can, I promise you that you will become a better musician because you will ultimately have more to express through your musicianship. A great deepening and maturing will take place in your musical expressions because the prime function of music is to express the life in Life. \n I once saw a wonderful sign on the door of a restaurant in Paris: “Fresh vegetables served according to the rhythm of the seasons.” Meditate on the times and seasons of your life in which music may sometimes be at the forefront and at other times in the background. Live, love, have a life, be well rounded, be an interested and interesting person. This life is the one chance you have to fully experience the delights of mortality in this beautiful creation the Lord has made expressly for us. As Isaiah wrote, “Jehovah is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.”5 Let Him be yours as well, for His purpose is that you “might have joy.”6 Alma asks us if we “have felt to sing the song of redeeming love.”7 May all of our music making and teaching convey that pure love melody, first to Deity and then to those we serve. Bach knew this, whose Solo Dei Gloria not only adorned his compositions, but also Doug’s home. \n Conclusion \n If I were to ask you to remember only one thing from this talk, it would be that “Comparison is the thief of joy.” Rejoice in who you are and in who you are becoming. Celebrate the fact that God made you, that there is just one of you that has ever been created, that you are unique and wonderful! Greet yourself in the mirror every morning in this way, even make a sign to stick on the mirror if it will help you to remember: “I am loveable, capable and competent, and when today is over, I will have made this world better!” Filling it with music is a great place to start. \n Thank you and God bless you! \n 1 The late O.M.

You might think there is a line on the calendar of my life separating when formal lessons ended and life as an organist began but that is not the case. \n Since I only have five minutes, I will spare you the details of why I chose the organ, and of my first several years of study. I do want to share some stories and facts that I hope inspire you on your journey. \n I will start with an experience that took place two floors beneath us, in E-208, the office of JJ Keeler, then chair of the BYU organ department. In those days, you did not come to BYU to audition seven months in advance of your first day as a freshman. You auditioned after you arrived. I found Brother Keeler stern and very intimidating. Instead of asking me to play, he proceeded to interview me. One question in particular I will never forget. “How many years of piano have you had?” “None” I answered innocently, “but I’ve had…” He cut me off. “You need to go home and take at least five years of piano. Then come back and we’ll talk.” I can’t go home, I thought. My parents dropped me off and left. I’ve moved into the dorms. I’m here to be an organ major. I don’t have a Plan B! Despite a quivering lower lip, I asked “May I at least play for you?” “(grumble grumble) Ok.” Short version: He let me in. But I had to make up for my lack of piano background through all four years of undergraduate study and during the summers. And I am grateful for that. \n Sometimes we don’t know we have weaknesses until others, often teachers, point them out to us. This is one of the many reasons I keep going back to take lessons or get coaching from organists that know a great deal more than I do. Often I might think I am putting the finishing touches on a piece, only to check it with the metronome, or after listening to a recording of myself. Ah, but there’s so much left to do and to fix! Sometimes metronomes, recorders and even the ears of others can be our teachers. \n Following college, much of my continuing education has come from attending workshops, concerts and conventions put on by the American Guild of Organists. I am a better teacher after taking notes at master classes by Russell Saunders, David Higgs, Olivier Latry and others. I know more about organs and the artists that play them because of the monthly The American Organist periodical. I am more motivated to practice and more creative in my registrations after attending wonderful concerts. I also have a growing list of organ literature I want to learn. This is not the last you will hear of the AGO this week, I guarantee it. That’s because this organization exists, much like this Workshop, to help you succeed. I recently returned from the regional AGO convention in San Diego, where the motivation I received will likely last well beyond the end of the year. Join the AGO! You’ll be glad you did. \n And now a little science. Did you know that your brain has a quality called plasticity? This means you can teach your brain, however old or young, new tricks. And in fact, your brain appreciates being taught NEW tricks. It might be fun to keep on doing what you already do well: Golf, juggling, piano. But the brain is kept young and supple by learning new coordination skills. Did you hear that? Can you think of anything \n that will dust the cobwebs out of your brain more thoroughly than playing the organ? And hey, it’s safer than taking up gymnastics. As far as I’m concerned, every Bach trio sonata is like learning a new sport. While working out a tricky section, you can now imagine the neurons in your brain branching out to new areas formerly unused. \n I once came to this Workshop and heard a teacher say, “As organists we do hard things.” I went home that summer and promptly told my family that we had a new family motto: We Do Hard Things. More recently I heard someone add to this bit of inspiration by quoting the verse in Philippians, “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.” (Philippians 4:13) So often in organ study or in life, we think, this is just too hard. I’m not up for this. And that’s probably true, if it were all up to just us and our skill sets. But it’s not. I have a former adult student who began every practice session with prayer. She often felt guided in her preparations for playing in church on Sunday. A current student shared with me recently that in the solitude of the chapel when she is practicing she has distinctly felt the approval of the Lord for the work she is engaged in. \n I am so grateful to be here — this is my favorite week of the year. I predict that you will simultaneously be stretched and challenged AND have a great time. And at the end of the week, I hope you’ll join me and many others in being a perennial student.\n__________ \n Daniel Kerr \n I am glad to add my welcome to all of you here at the BYU Organ Workshop. Each of you is here to learn something about the organ. Perhaps you are just starting out; others of you may be capable players who are here for a boost and to polish up some specific aspect of the craft. Regardless of where you are in your abilities, the fact that you are here speaks to your desire to improve. So, during this week, dig into the material and do your best to master it! \n I have found an analogy that is helpful in demonstrating the value and importance of thorough, dedicated, diligent practice, and it has to do with construction. Now, I am hardly an expert on construction management, but in the eleven years that I have lived in Rexburg, Idaho, I have seen many buildings built from the ground up, and have found some (hopefully) helpful parallels between building a building and developing as a musician. \n Every time a new building is announced, there is a festive groundbreaking, where speeches are given, prayers are offered, and an artist’s rendering of the completed structure is displayed. There is a great sense of excitement and anticipation for the building that is to come. \n But then an interesting thing happens: seemingly nothing! At least, it appears that nothing happens. But work is going on. Rocks and debris are cleared; the land is smoothed and graded. Trenches are dug deeply. Rock is sometimes blasted out, and then wooden planks are lowered into the trenches. It is hot, dusty, dirty, messy work. It is unglamorous, and bears little resemblance to what the final product will look like. \n After the wooden forms are in place, then concrete is poured into the forms and the foundation is laid. Once the concrete has cured, the forms are removed and then repositioned to form the foundation walls. Concrete is again poured and cured to form the foundation walls. This takes a long time, and happens under ground level, out of sight. Up on the surface, it looks as if the project has stalled. \n Not until this preliminary foundation work has been laid does the form of the building begin to take shape. First, structural steel is anchored to the foundation walls, outer walls go up, a roof goes on, and we begin to see the result of all of the preparatory work. At this point, the project moves quickly with windows and \n doors, siding and landscaping, and the building looks much as it did in the artists’ conceptualization. When the building is completed, it is dedicated and put to use. If the preparation work was done carefully and correctly, the building will stand solidly for many, many years. \n It is much the same way with a musician learning a new piece of music, or, for that matter, learning an instrument. Initially the student is excited to learn a new piece and be able to play it like the masters. But first there is real work that needs to take place. Hours upon hours of time must be devoted to the process of learning the piece. Fingering must be written into the score; phrasings, articulations, and manual changes must all be determined and practiced. Left hand, right hand, and (in the case of us organists) feet need to be coordinated. Like laying the foundation of a building, this is very slow, tedious, time-consuming work that is done out of sight in the practice room (or an empty chapel). It is not at all glamorous or particularly exciting. It is very exacting labor. But eventually patterns and scale figurations are learned, the piece eventually comes together, and, if the preparation was adequate, it can be polished to performance standard relatively easily. The better and more thorough the preparation, the better the final performance will be, and the longer the piece of music will stay with the performer. \n Now, I don’t speak of dusty, difficult, exacting labor to be negative about what this week is about. On the contrary, I offer it as encouragement and something of a promise. The more carefully the groundwork is laid, the more rewarding the final result will be. So dig in with enthusiasm! Be patient with yourself, give yourself a sufficient amount of time and energy to be diligent and work hard, and if you do, you will be amazed at the results. Much like the seed of faith grows up into a tree bearing much fruit (as described in Alma 32), your faith and effort will grow up into a technique that is sure and solid, and your proficiency at the organ will grow and flourish. I wish you all the best as you embark on this journey of inspiration, preparation and progress! \n __________ \n There is a saying that states, “T \n Alena Hall \n he music is not in the notes, but in the silence between.” Upon first hearing \n this, in my literalist state, I wondered what kind of fool would say something like that – certainly not a \n musician. But upon more thought and experience I can understand what the author of this quote might have \n been suggesting. \n How many of us have ever heard a young student plow through a piece giving little notice or consideration \n to that small notated silence called a rest? In contrast, how many of us have paused our breathing as the \n conductor on his podium raises his arms, ready to launch his orchestra into the initial downbeat? \n In the “Organ-World,” music can be found in the silence after an introductory presentation of a chorale, just \n prior to a performance of a favorite chorale prelude. Or perhaps, in a French toccata full of furious notes that \n climax on a dissonant dominant chord that dissipates into silence – it is the silence that enhances the \n triumphant moment when major tonality is introduced to conclude the chaos. I personally love that moment \n of silence between movements of the Mendelssohn sonatas, Widor symphonies, or a Bach prelude and \n fugue. The sound evaporates, a percussive change of stops is heard, and then a small juncture of stillness. \n And what of that glorious moment in a reverberant cathedral when a stunning recital ends . . . the final chord \n has been released by the organist, but the sound echoes, then vanishes? \n Music is notes, pitches, rhythms, sharps, flats, bar lines, staffs, clefs, harmonies, and many other things. But \n what is music to you? Is it a way to relax? Is it an outlet for stress and anxiety? Is it a way to convey \n emotions and thoughts in the deepest way possible? Is it communing with God? Is it a means of helping \n share the Holy Spirit? I am certain that every person here has been moved in deep ways by music. \n As a musician you become the instrument that conveys what it is the music has to say. The notes can be \n boring and stagnant or they can dance with life and passion. A hymn can be played in a way that hypnotizes \n the congregation and no thought is given to the words. Yet even an amateur organist who is well-prepared \n can share the abundance of spirit a hymn has to offer. And so music is not merely sound, it is emotion, it is \n feeling. Music is also discipline. It is consistent effort. And it is practicing. \n I remember the first time I realized that you could practice the organ. It was the summer that I turned twelve \n years old and it had never occurred to me that our church organist might come to the church during the week \n to practice. I was ecstatic about the idea of being able to have the organ all to myself. My wise piano \n teacher, who also served as our ward organist, arranged for me to have unlimited access to our church and \n its organ. He also offered free organ lessons in addition to the paid piano lessons he was giving me. The \n only catch was practice hours. To receive the free organ lessons, I had to practice two hours a day on the \n organ, in addition to the two hours a day he required on the piano. I accepted the challenged and practiced \n diligently for two months. At the end of those two months, this cunning man moved and I became the new \n ward organist. \n This experience began my journey into organ playing. Some of you have become organists out of love for \n the instrument or its literature, or as a means of developing your God-given talents. Some of you, have been \n figuratively tossed to the wolves in that your congregation needs an organist and you are it. We all have \n desires to be a better organist, even if our journeys began for different reasons. Progression at the organ \n occurs in two ways: learning and practicing. \n So let’s tie this all together. You are here this week to learn. You will learn pedal techniques, manual \n techniques, practice techniques, registration guidelines, rules of theory, shortcuts, tips, do’s and don’ts of \n every sort. And hopefully in the midst of all this technical “stuff”, you will experience the silent moments \n like those I described. Moments of beauty and delight, compelling and gratifying. \n The real work begins at the close of this workshop. The learning should continue but progress will be made in the practice room. Think of this workshop as the notes, rhythms and technicalities of the music. The silence then is the coming year of practice in which your passion for music increases along with your command of the instrument. You will find as I have found that there really is much music to be found in the silence. I’ve always felt the music department here should adopt BYU’s motto with one slight change: “enter to learn, go forth to practice.” \n May God bless you in your efforts. \n _ _________ \n Brian Mathias \n I’m grateful for the opportunity to share a few of my thoughts with you this morning. As I’ve pondered over what “words of wisdom” I might share with you, the topic that has continually been upon my mind is why learning to play the organ is worth our time. Since I began teaching at this workshop in 2010, I have been inspired by the stories I hear from workshop attendees regarding why they come to this workshop. I meet many people who have recently been called as a ward organist, and come here to try and learn just enough to help them stay afloat in their new callings. A few years ago, I met a brother from Canada who had many years of professional experience as a church organist, but had recently joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and came simply in hopes of learning more about music in our church. Still others have been coming to this workshop since before it was the BYU Organ Workshop, and come each year to get their yearly dose of motivation, encouragement, and instruction. Your stories and enthusiasm for this instrument have been an annual source of inspiration to me, and frequently serve to remind me of why I chose to pursue organ in the first place. \n We live in a world where many things compete for our time for our time every day—some of them menial, and others of great importance. I feel confident that we could all agree that amid all the things we are responsible for, it is often difficult to carve out time to improve our organ playing. For most of us, playing the organ is not the most important responsibility in our lives, and it may not even make the top ten. However, we make time to do it, and for many different reasons. This morning, I would like to share why I feel that working to improve our skills is worth the sacrifice of time it requires. \n For several years, I have been impressed by the following line from the music section of the Church Handbook: “Congregational singing has a unique and often underused power for unifying members as they worship together” (Handbook 2, 14.4.3., emphasis added). Why is this power “often underused”? In many cases, it is because the members of our congregations simply are not participating. Cultural changes of the last twenty to thirty years have created a society in which many people do not sing, and many possess no inclination toward sacred music. Additionally, many people are simply distracted by conversations with others, the ever-greater pull of smartphones, and attending to the needs of children. Perhaps most fatally, many (and perhaps most) people in our congregations have never actually experienced the power of good congregational singing, and therefore see no compelling reason to participate. \n Sadly, we live in a time when this power is needed more than ever. Our religious convictions are increasingly being viewed by the world as second-class convictions, and the Christian way of life is quickly coming to be regarded as “outdated.” It is gradually becoming more difficult to be a faithful follower of Jesus Christ. In order to maintain our faith amid the storm that surrounds us, we need the strength and renewal that our weekly worship can provide. We need to be nourished by the spirit of God. We need to feel at one with our brothers and sisters in the cause of Christ. \n This, I feel, is where our organ playing comes in. While many people are currently choosing not to participate in congregational singing, that doesn’t mean they can’t be persuaded. A well-prepared and confidently-played hymn introduction can do much to invite participation. Appropriate registration can help people sense the message of the hymn text as they sing. Thoughtful attention to phrasing can help those who sing understand old words in a new way. Well-prepared, thoughtful organ playing encourages singing, and uniting in song invites the Spirit of the Lord in a powerful way. I think we have already experienced that power this morning, and I’m confident that we will continue to experience it throughout this week. \n While it’s easy to get bogged down by the mechanics of playing the organ and the many challenges that confront us at each step of our progress, we should always keep in mind the tremendous impact our efforts can have on the people we serve. This, in my opinion, makes every hour of practicing our pedaling or polishing our hymn playing worthwhile. We may never fully know the impact of our efforts on the members of our congregations, but I assure you that the time each of us spend to hone our craft is time spent in humble service to our brothers and sisters, many of whom come to worship in desperate need of nourishment. Let us all give appropriate time to the improvement of our skills, so that they may be used to make the unique power of congregational singing not “underused,” but a weekly source of strength. \n BYU Organ Workshop Keynote Address\nAugust 1, 2017, by Dr. Clay Christiansen \n Brothers and sisters – my dear fellow organists in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. What a blessed lot we are! What a noble and unique calling we have: to lift souls through the matchless power of inspiring music in the worship of our Heavenly Father and His Son, our Savior and Redeemer! Do we fully appreciate the heavenly gift we literally hold in our hands and feet — the gift of bringing the harmony, unity and peace of heaven directly to the hearts of Heavenly Father’s children? Music aligns the very molecules of our soul which vibrate in harmony with the air around us to bring us a measure of the eternal unity and harmony that pervades heaven. We actually feel the peace of heaven in our souls. Truly, music is rightly called “The Divine Art.” \n Ponder with me, if you will, the unique characteristics of our particular musical instrument, the organ. Its profound, gentle low tones we sometimes feel more than we hear. Its sustained, unwavering still small voice can whisper so subtly that we must be still to hear it, and yet the glorious splendor of its unwaveringly powerful chords – tuned vibrations from lowest to highest musical range – bring the almighty power of God and the glorious exalted splendor of our eternal home back before our spiritual eyes. Is it any wonder that such god-like qualities caused the great 19th and 20th century French organist and composer Charles Marie Widor to call the organ “The voice of God!” \n During the next few days you have special opportunity to further develop and hone your abilities to use this wonderful voice in the service of Heavenly Father. If you put your prayerful heart and soul into your work, you will bear testimony to all who worship just as surely as those who stand at the pulpit. If you seek to ever more effectively sing the inspired words of our hymns through the organ’s voice, then the songs of the righteous will truly be a prayer unto the Lord. \n As a long-standing member of the Church’s Musical Instrument Selection Committee or MISC, may I now speak about the organs that we play in our meetinghouses. Please forgive me for perhaps boring you with detailed information, but experience has shown that many of you have questions regarding official Church policies. I hope that this citing of “chapter and verse” will be helpful to you. If you do not catch all of it you desire this morning, I’m told by Dr. Cook that this keynote address will be posted on the BYU Organ Workshop website. \n For those few of you blessed to play pipe organs in your buildings, the Church’s official policy as found in the Operations \u0026 Maintenance Policy Point Manual on page 39 under “Replacement Standards” is: “Pipe organs should be maintained as required and not replaced.” If problems are identified such as broken parts or insufficient quality of sound, the organ is to be renovated using “Pipe Organ Renovation Guidelines” also found in the Policy Point Manual. These Pipe Organ Renovation Guidelines specify additions such as multiple memories, celeste duplexed on Swell and Great manuals, mutations including 2 2/3’ and 1 3/5’, chorus reed at 16’ as well as 8’ and 4’ pitches on manual and pedal, sufficient pedal foundations at 16’ and even 32’ pitch using digital stops if necessary and \n maximum flexibility of existing pipe ranks, including finish voicing to correct rough and uneven pipe speech and to transform it into smooth and warm sound. \n Most of you, however, play digital organs each Sunday. The quality and variety of sound found in our digital organs has vastly improved over the 25 years that I have sat on the MISC. We have been blessed to work closely with our digital organ vendors Allen, Johannus and formerly Rodgers to produce custom 2-manual LDS instruments that have unusually comprehensive specifications. Eight foot and four foot string and flute celestes create the “still, small voice” with soft 32’ pedal perhaps felt more than heard. Beautifully colorful imitative solo reeds such as English Horn, Krummhorn, Clarinet, Oboe and French Horn sing reverent melodies, as do open and capped flutes at 16’, 8’, 4’, 2 2/3’, 2’ and 1 3/5’ pitches. A full chorus of principals from 16’ through mixtures with the added celestial fire of chorus reeds at 32’, 16’, 8’ and 4’ pitches sound the full musical range to invoke the splendor and power of God’s glory. We hope you will not be afraid to explore and use these voices to sing the hymns into the hearts of the people. \n Useful examples which you may use as models for such registration combinations should be factory preset into memories 1, 2, 15 or 16 of our LDS digital instruments built since 1999. A printed “Preset Registrations” sheet was shipped with each of these instruments along with the Owner’s Manual. You may also download these Preset Registration sheets which include basic registration instructions by visiting lds.org and clicking on “Scriptures and Study,” then “Music,” then “Accompanying Others,” then “Playing the Organ” and scrolling down and clicking onto “Owner’s Manuals for Church Organs.” \n We are aware that some of you are playing older digital instruments which do not allow the variety, flexibility or quality of sound found in our organs built in the last decade or two. If you long for a newer instrument and wonder what the replacement guidelines might be, here they are quoted directly, again from the Operations \u0026 Maintenance Policy Point Manual, page 38 under “Replacement Standards” for electronic organs: “Age based electronic organ replacement should be on a case by case basis. Consider the following guidelines: –replace organs 33 years old and older.” \n Replacement may be also justified if the organ is in poor condition. “Poor Condition” is defined as: “The organ no longer produces a quality sound as designed and shows substantial mechanical and outer-case damage. The organ will not work properly without major repairs.” \n Should replacement be deemed justified, you might like to be aware of the two “Replacement Directives” printed at the bottom of page 38: \n Now may I share a few of my thoughts on accompaniment of congregational hymns which is the most important part of your role as a church organist. It can make such a wonderful difference to your playing if you can sing the words of the hymn in your heart as you play! Spend some time pondering the words. The closer they are to being memorized, the less you will need to keep one eye referencing \n them as you play the notes. Conversely, the better you know the notes, the more easily you can concentrate on the words. To a certain degree they can shape your articulation and phrasing. Certainly they should influence your registration! \n When I was an undergraduate organ student here at BYU I was called as organist for BYU 65th Ward. We met in the auditorium of the old Joseph Smith Memorial Building which seated maybe 1000 or more people and housed the old 80-plus rank four-manual Austin pipe organ which was taken out of the Salt Lake Tabernacle when the new Æolian-Skinner was installed in 1948. As I was called, the 65th Ward Bishopric counseled me, “This is a large organ and we are a small congregation. Please do not use too much of the organ or it will blow us away!” So I started hymn introductions and first verses with less organ than I personally desired – in this case secondary principals without mixtures. As the hymn progressed from verse to verse I gradually added stops. The congregation’s singing gradually increased as the organ built with each verse. Guess what! By the last verse of a big hymn I was using full organ and they were singing their hearts out! Time after time I was told by my fellow ward members how blessed we were to have that large and wonderful organ for our sacrament meetings. So the secret for hymns of praise is: Start conservatively and build with each verse until the final verse includes 32’ pedal reed chorus, manual 16’ reed chorus and, of course, mixtures. \n What about meditative hymns such as sacrament hymns? May I share with you two rather unorthodox registrations I use in my ward for a verse or two of a sacrament hymn? I love the rather somber but round, warm and soothing sound of what the French call fonds d’orgue, that is the foundation stops of the organ combined without any upper work. Pull on and couple together all 8’ principals, flutes and strings without celestes, maybe adding a 4’ flute or two and you should have a profound “voice of God” kind of sound that works for the first verse of a sacrament hymn. And, by the way, if you use this sound on the Great manual to play a hymn tune down an octave in the tenor range with your right hand while your left hand accompanies with strings and celeste on the Swell manual, you will hear a very useful and sacred prelude sound reminiscent of General Conference. \n My second registration is definitely unorthodox for hymn accompaniment. I save it for the occasional ethereal verse of a sacrament hymn such as the second verse of hymns 181 and 182 which speak of “rev’rence sweet” and of joining “the heav’nly throng.” For such ethereal verses I sometimes combine and couple together all 8’ and 4’ strings with celestes. Only bolster the sound with an 8’ flute or principal if necessary. \n While we’re considering registration of sacrament hymns, may I suggest that not all verses of every sacrament hymn call for a subdued registration. More than a few of our sacrament hymns end with an exultant verse which calls for an exultant registration through mixture and reeds. A classic example is the final verse of “While of These Emblems We Partake:” \n But rise triumphant from the tomb,\nAnd in eternal splendor bloom,\nFreed from the pow’r of death and pain, With Christ, the Lord, to rule and reign. \n I doubt you could show me a more triumphant verse in all hymnody! It seems to me that the power of these words is denied unless your registration lifts up the congregation. Yes, I would use Hymn Preset General 10 – full organ, including 32’ reed to “…rise triumphant from the tomb.” \n Other final exultant sacrament hymn verses I would urge you to consider include hymn numbers 175-6-7, 183-4, and 192 \u0026 195. A building registration during the final lines of hymns 172, 181 and 193 seems appropriate. \n The Brethren have recently called on us to renew our commitment to making the sacrament portion of our worship more meaningful. Your inspired registration of the sacrament hymn can directly contribute to this sacred experience. \n Finally, I cannot leave the subject of congregational hymn accompaniment without touching on the matter of appropriate embellishment of the printed hymn harmonization. Some of you may have noticed that I am unable to get through all verses of General Conference rest hymns without adding at least a few passing tones and occasionally reharmonizing a chord of two for emphasis, particularly during the last verse. My plan is to play the first verse straight, then gradually unfold embellishments as the hymn builds through successive verses. I am more conservative in this endeavor at General Conference than when playing for sacrament meeting. Reharmonization and even an interlude with transposition up a step can be very inspiring for exultant hymns sung in your own congregation. Such practices I heartily endorse. Hymn singing is meant to be a powerful experience! \n It has been an honor to speak to you about such a sacred trust as we all have as church musicians. The Church is so blessed to have you who are so dedicated to improving your talents to bring organ music to the hearts of our worshipers. That you are dedicating a week of your time and money to be here to receive this remarkable training is proof of your commitment to the Work of the Lord. May you go forth with His blessing to inspire and impart what you have learned to the training of others, especially of the younger generation, in your wards and stakes. Know that we love you and appreciate you and pray for you. \n In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. \n Brian Mathias, DMA \n Keynote Address\nBYU Organ Workshop 2018 \n Good morning, everyone. It’s wonderful to look out and see many familiar faces as well as many new ones! This is my ninth year at this workshop, and though my role will be somewhat different this year than in previous years, I consider it a great honor to be here with you. For many years, I have drawn great inspiration from the people that come to this workshop. Your dedication to this marvelous instrument and the sacrifices you make to be here are so admirable and are a great reminder to me of why I love the organ. Before I start into my remarks for today, I want to let you know how much I love and admire the people you’ll be learning from this week. The instructors of this workshop are some of my closest friends and I hold them in highest respect. I encourage you to take every opportunity to learn from them this week. They have much to offer, and your lives will be enriched by the time that you spend with them. \n Those of you who have been coming to the Organ Workshop for some time are aware that my life has undergone some rather drastic changes since we sat here one year ago listening to Clay Christiansen give the keynote address. At that time, I was an adjunct faculty member here at BYU. The Tabernacle Choir had posted an open position, but had not yet begun reviewing applications. If I look a little older and more haggard than when you saw me last year, it’s because I spent the last four months of 2017 practicing and nervously waiting, which culminated in an audition that I never wish to repeat, followed by more nervous waiting, followed by two weeks of major secret keeping, followed by four months of teaching at BYU and working with the Tabernacle Choir simultaneously, followed by a trip to France with the BYU organ department, followed by moving (twice!), followed by the Tabernacle Choir’s \n Classic Coast Tour in June. I should also mention that my first few months with the Tabernacle Choir included two complete performances of Handel’s Messiah, April General Conference, and recording a new CD! It has been an eventful year at the Mathias home. After all that, I’m happy to report to you that my children still recognize me and my wife still likes me! As a family, we feel tremendously blessed by the events of the last year. It has been a year full of great challenges and even greater blessings. \n In this magnificent whirlwind, I’ve had to learn many things very quickly. As I have pondered what I might share with you today, I felt it fitting to relate to you some of the things I’ve learned during these first several months on the job in hopes that some of them might be useful to all of you, wherever you might be in your organ playing. \n To provide context for these remarks, I will briefly describe what being a Tabernacle Organist entails. As most of you are probably aware, the Tabernacle Choir has three full-time and two part-time organists. Our most important duty is to accompany the Mormon Tabernacle Choir in General Conference, weekly Music and the Spoken Word broadcasts, concerts, and rehearsals. In addition to our work with the choir, we perform daily organ recitals on Temple Square and provide music for various other events on Temple Square as needed. All of this requires a lot of practicing, and that is where we spend a great deal of our time each week. \n For many years as an observer of the tabernacle organists, I marveled at the high standard of excellence that has been a part of the Temple Square musical tradition for decades. As a newcomer to this group, I am keenly aware of the burden that is now mine to help uphold that standard. Sadly, I have learned over the last several months that at least one of the Tabernacle Organists is very, very human! But I have also learned a great deal by pushing myself harder \n than ever before and have been the recipient of much-needed grace in times of need. Today I would like to share with you some of the insights gained from these experiences. \n The first lesson might seem obvious, but it is that thorough preparation is essential to a good performance. This is a concept I’ve believed in and practiced for a long time. However, I’ve come to appreciate it more deeply in recent months as I have been working to hone my practice habits to a higher degree than ever before. As I’m sure you can imagine, the Tabernacle organ bench is, at times, a very hot seat. The pressure of playing—particularly as a soloist—on a live TV broadcast can be immense. I will never forget sitting on the bench during my first broadcast this last March. As the time approached for my solo—the fiery final movement of Charles-Marie Widor’s sixth organ symphony—I saw, out of the corner of my eye, a cameraman getting into position just a few feet to my left. In that instant, the reality of what I was about to do struck me in a rather profound and terrifying way! Thankfully, I had been warned by my colleagues about this, and I had some sense of the mental struggle I was about to go through. What we all need during performance, whether it’s in a recital, a church meeting, or even a routine practice session, is to remain focused, calm, and confident. You know as well as I do that this is extremely difficult at times, and that is where good preparation will save you. In this moment, I was very grateful that I had spent the last few weeks drilling this piece of music in every imaginable way—slowly, in sections, in various combinations of parts, in alternate rhythms, recording myself, playing for others, etc. This preparation gave me a very reliable foundation to fall back on even in moments when I struggled to maintain perfect focus. \n This experience also taught me the value of a different kind of preparation. In the weeks leading up to my first day on the bench, my colleagues encouraged me to practice playing through the entire broadcast from start to finish. This is something I wouldn’t have thought to \n give much attention to, but it proved to be one of the most valuable steps in my preparation. Because most Music and the Spoken Word broadcasts today proceed without any announcement between pieces, we often have a very short amount of time to get prepared to begin the next piece on the program. Immediately after releasing the final chord of the Widor Final, I had to jump right into “His Yoke is Easy,” from Handel’s Messiah with no time to rearrange the music on the rack. This proved to be a challenging transition, but with plenty of practice, it was perfectly manageable. Playing through the entire broadcast, from “Gently Raise the Sacred Strain” to the iconic “As the Dew from Heaven Distilling,” a few dozen times in the days leading up to that first Sunday morning was a lifesaver, and it’s something I’ve made a consistent habit of since that time. You might consider giving this a try for your next sacrament meeting. Practicing in this way is a great way to circumvent silly errors such as starting on the wrong memory level, hitting the wrong piston, forgetting to turn pages between pieces, etc., and can also help you prepare for the mental transition required to move from one piece to the next. Building these habits in a less pressure-filled situation (when no one is watching you!) has been very helpful to me, and I think many of you may benefit from trying it as well. \n The next lesson is that there is never enough time to prepare, so it’s important to use practice time efficiently. As I mentioned earlier, between daily recitals, choir rehearsals, broadcasts, and concerts, we are performing on a nearly daily basis. There is new music to learn and practice every week. I’m sure many of you feel the same way. Whether you’re preparing hymns for sacrament meeting, repertoire pieces for an Independent Study course, or technical exercises for an upcoming lesson, it’s hard to squeeze everything into the time you have available. For this reason, we would all benefit from examining the way we use our practice time. Allow me to offer a few suggestions for this. \n First, use goals to structure and plan your practice. I often keep a list of every piece I need to be working on, ordered by priority. At the start of my practicing each day, I look over this list and make a plan for what I want or need to accomplish with each piece and how I will divide my time in order to reach that goal. Of course, it frequently happens that I underestimate the amount of time a particularly tricky passage might take or perhaps manage to make the progress I need on another passage in less time than estimated. Your goals will need to have a little flexibility, especially in the beginning. The important concept here is that goal-oriented practice encourages a mindset in which you are not simply sitting down to practice for an hour— you are sitting down to accomplish a specific goal or set of goals. With this mindset, every minute counts for something. If you’ve never practiced in this way, I encourage you to try it. You will be surprised how much you can accomplish. \n Second, use practice techniques that are efficient. In my roughly twelve years of teaching, I found that the majority of students that came to me had never really been taught practice habits beyond the “sit down and play it a bunch of times” method. If this is your current routine, listen carefully this week, and I’m certain that you’ll come away with some helpful strategies and techniques that will help you practice more effectively. Organ playing is a complex task, and trying to play everything at once at full tempo often amounts to “practicing” mistakes that later have to be corrected. It is a well-known fact that the shortest distance between any two points is a straight line. If we apply this rule to our practicing, we might find that learning the right notes with the correct fingering by slowing down, playing hands or feet separately, or working in small sections allows us to take the shortest, most direct path to accomplishing our goal. Many people feel that they don’t have time to do this kind of practicing because it takes too long. Personally, I \n don’t have time to not do this kind of practicing. It is the fastest way I know of to learn music, and that’s something we can all appreciate and use in our lives. \n Looking at this issue from the opposite direction, I would also encourage you to make sure that you’re not taking more time than is actually needed to learn something to the point that you can perform it confidently and securely. We all know the feeling of having a hard time putting something down during a practice session. “Just one more time,” we tell ourselves. And then another. And another. I’m absolutely in favor of being thorough, but at a certain point, the repetition can become counterproductive and take precious time away from other pieces that might need some attention. Work until you accomplish your goal, and then move on to whatever is next. \n Once you have made your preparations, it’s time to actually perform, by which I mean to play in any situation where other people are listening, which nearly always influences our thoughts as we play. This could be a sacrament meeting or other worship service, an organ lesson or recital, or something else. The BYU School of Music offers a course in performance psychology taught by Dr. Jon Skidmore. One of the essential concepts he teaches is that at a certain point, you have to say to yourself “my preparation for this performance is complete.” At that point, you have to let go and acknowledge that the time for preparing is over and the time for performing has come. Dr. Skidmore then encourages students to adopt a mindset of being “Bold, Confident, and Free” when performing. \n When I arrived at the University of Kansas as a new doctoral student, I had established a routine of meticulous, methodical practice and tried to carry that approach over into my performance. Imagine my surprise when during one of my first lessons with Professor James Higdon, I was playing Jehan Alain’s Litanies when I heard him yell from the back of the recital \n hall “Faster!” In this lesson and many subsequent lessons, we discussed how there is a time to be slow and methodical, and there is also a time to let it rip. To be clear, I’m not suggesting that we should perform recklessly, too fast, or overly loud. What I mean to say is that performance is not the time to be worrying about making mistakes—that’s what practicing is for. Performing is about making music and sharing something with your listeners that can’t be communicated any other way. Practice diligently when it’s time to practice, and when it’s time to perform, let it rip! \n The third lesson is that there is tremendous value in asking questions to people who have answers. Between the Tabernacle Choir’s conductors and organists, I work with a small group of some of the most capable, knowledgeable, and talented musicians I have encountered anywhere. This is an incredible privilege, and one I am most grateful for. The combined wisdom and professional experience in this group is mind boggling. In the choir office, there is a closet of shared organ accompaniments. For each piece in the choir’s repertoire, there is a score that is prepared to reduce or eliminate page turns. Each score is also marked with the registrations previously used, manual changes, and various other helpful notations. As a newcomer to the staff, this closet is a goldmine containing decades of battle-tested performance knowledge. Even with this great resource available, I still often have questions about various things. Taking the time to ask my colleagues has provided many opportunities to not only get my questions answered, but to learn lots of other things that I didn’t even know I needed to learn. You will have many opportunities to ask questions this week, and I encourage you to do so. You might worry that your question is a “stupid” question, but in reality, there’s a good chance that someone sitting near you is wondering the same thing! You will rarely have the opportunity to be surrounded by so many experienced organists, so don’t let the week pass without getting answers to your burning questions. \n Fourth, never let pride or ego get in the way of making good music. I’ve just described the incredible depth of talent and accomplishment among the choir staff. What’s even more impressive is that they all get along—something that highly accomplished musicians are not always known for! This is so essential to accomplishing the Tabernacle Choir’s mission “to bring joy, peace, and healing to its listeners.” While there are varied and diverse opinions among the staff on various musical issues, what they uniformly understand is that making good music is more important than being “right.” Given that so many of our efforts as organists are directed toward the act of worship, we would all do well to adopt this philosophy. Our congregations, choirs, and we ourselves will be uplifted in a more profound way as a result. \n The last lesson is something I’ve already alluded to: that at some point (and hopefully sooner than later), we must come to accept our own imperfection. Despite our best efforts, at the end of the day, we are human. Have you ever made a mistake in General Conference? I have! If your Sunday morning mistakes are keeping you awake at night, I encourage you to enjoy a peaceful night of sleep on me. Of course, I don’t intend to make light of this or suggest that we approach our responsibilities casually. I practiced more for April General Conference than almost any event I can remember. However, it is true that despite my best preparations, I didn’t play quite as cleanly as I would have liked to. But that’s the beautiful thing: when we give our best efforts, we receive the gift of grace from a loving God and his beloved Son, who made an infinite sacrifice in order that we could be strengthened in our weakness, and our imperfections made perfect. Because of this, we can miss a few notes and still make a perfect offering by giving the best of ourselves and accepting his grace where we fall short. \n The day before my first Music and the Spoken Word broadcast in March, I went to the Tabernacle to practice in the afternoon. After running through everything several times, I felt that \n I had done everything I could do, but I was still struggling to utter the all-important phrase “my preparation for this performance is complete.” Given the magnitude of what I was about to do, I felt that no amount of practicing would be sufficient for me to feel like I had done enough. While sitting in my office packing up to go home, I recalled a scripture from the 84th section of the Doctrine and Covenants that I was previously familiar with, but which suddenly took on an entirely new meaning: “And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.” \n I truly believe that what we do at the organ each week matters. When we combine our efforts with the Spirit’s power, we have the ability to strengthen our brothers and sisters in profound and even life-changing ways. I hope and pray that the Lord will be with each of you in your efforts to serve the Lord’s children through your service on the bench of the King of Instruments in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. \n VideoOn Campus Students\n\n\tMusic Majors\n\t\n\t\tDegree Programs\n\t\tCareer and Income Opportunities\n\t\tAdmissions and Scholarship\n\t\tStudents\n\t\n\n\tNon-Music Majors\n\t\n\t\tGroup Organ Study\n\t\tPrivate Organ Study\n\t\tOrgan Registration\n\t\n\n\n \n Music Majors\n\t\n\t\tDegree Programs\n\t\tCareer and Income Opportunities\n\t\tAdmissions and Scholarship\n\t\tStudents\n\t\n \n Degree Programs \n Career and Income Opportunities \n Admissions and Scholarship \n Students \n Non-Music Majors\n\t\n\t\tGroup Organ Study\n\t\tPrivate Organ Study\n\t\tOrgan Registration\n\t\n \n Group Organ Study \n Private Organ Study \n Organ Registration \n Off Campus Students\n\n\tFinding An Organ Teacher\n\tBYU Programs for Off-Campus Organists (Organ Certification)\n\t\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 1-2\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 3-6\n\t\tRepertoire for BYU Independent Study Organ Courses\n\t\n\n\tContinuing Your Organ Training PDF\n\tMaterials Needed For Independent Study Organ Classes PDF\n\tBYU Organ Workshop\n\tOrganTutor\n\tMentor Instructions\n\n \n Finding An Organ Teacher \n BYU Programs for Off-Campus Organists (Organ Certification)\n\t\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 1-2\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 3-6\n\t\tRepertoire for BYU Independent Study Organ Courses\n\t\n \n Independent Study Organ Levels 1-2 \n Independent Study Organ Levels 3-6 \n Repertoire for BYU Independent Study Organ Courses \n Continuing Your Organ Training PDF \n Materials Needed For Independent Study Organ Classes PDF \n BYU Organ Workshop \n OrganTutor \n Mentor Instructions \n Events\n\n\tBYU Organ Workshop\n\tPipe Organ Study Tour of Germany\n\tAGO Events\n\t\n\t\tUtah Valley Chapter AGO\n\t\tSalt Lake City Chapter AGO\n\t\n\n\n \n BYU Organ Workshop \n Pipe Organ Study Tour of Germany \n AGO Events\n\t\n\t\tUtah Valley Chapter AGO\n\t\tSalt Lake City Chapter AGO\n\t\n \n Utah Valley Chapter AGO \n Salt Lake City Chapter AGO \n Ward Organists\n\n\tThe New Ward Organist\n\tWard Organist Training\n\t\n\t\tOrgan Training Outlines\n\t\n\n\tTraveling Organ Workshops\n\tOrgan Training Resources PDF\n\tU of U Group Organ Instruction\n\tUsing OrganTutor PDF\n\tFree Accompaniment PDF\n\n \n The New Ward Organist \n Ward Organist Training\n\t\n\t\tOrgan Training Outlines\n\t\n \n Organ Training Outlines \n Traveling Organ Workshops \n Organ Training Resources PDF \n U of U Group Organ Instruction \n Using OrganTutor PDF \n Free Accompaniment PDF \n Workshops\n\n\tOnline Training Sessions\n\t2021 BYU Organ Workshop\n\tTraveling Organ Workshops\n\n \n Online Training Sessions \n 2021 BYU Organ Workshop \n Traveling Organ Workshops \n Info \u0026 Reference\n\n\tOrgan Training Resources PDF\n\tCarol Dean\n\tContinuing Your Organ Training\n\tDouglas E.

Monson\nDirector, BYU School of Music\nAugust 8, 2006\nWhen my daughter Laura was about three years old, she was engrossed at my side one day, watching me at the piano. On a lark, just to see what she would say, I asked, “Laura, I notice that the notes on this end of the piano [bang, bang, bang] sound a lot different than the notes on this other end of the piano [bang, bang, bang]. What do you think the difference is?” She puzzled up her face for a minute, played a few of the keys on both ends herself, and then announced, with finality: “Well, these notes are the little notes [at the top end of the keyboard], and these notes are the big notes [at the bottom end].” Then she left, with a smile.\nThat moment was a capsule reflection of a question I have carried with me through many years. If such simple assumptions like “high” and “low” didn’t seem to have much universal meaning (at least for her, since she intuitively chose “little” and “big” instead), what does music really mean?\nYears earlier I had been flailing away with a baton in the apartment of Maestro Joseph Rosenstock, when I was studying orchestral conducting. He sat at the piano, reducing the full orchestral score of Beethoven symphonies and playing them at the keyboard (something I’m sure all of you can do), while I conducted from behind my music stand. In the middle of some movement or other he suddenly stopped playing, looked a little disgusted, and told me to go sit on the couch. He came over, opened his score, shoved it under my nose and said, “You have to read the score like a book!” I had no idea what he was talking about. How do you read a score\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlike a book? It’s a musical score, not a book! He means me to see some sort of meaning in this score that I can’t find. What does this music mean—for me, for others?\nGrowing up I tried to immerse myself in music in every way possible, because its meaning seemed magic to me. When it first came out, I sat through The Music Man seven times in two days (back in the days when theaters didn’t kick you out between shows). As I grew older, I tried everything that had anything to do with music. I played clarinet from the second grade on, joining bands, orchestras, chamber groups, and playing in festivals and solo competitions. I spent hours at the piano, picking out tunes and chords by ear. I studied a little violin—even buying a violin at the end of my mission to carry home. I bought a 12-string Gibson guitar and a banjo, becoming a groupie to a guy I worked with who had grown up in the Ozarks, a great bluegrass player of “old-time” music, and we’d sit in his living room with the tape recorder going until 1 or 2 a.m. I spent hours locked away with BYU’s music synthesizer, weaving patch chords together and trying to make interesting sounds. I worked as a music copyist and played a Fender Rhodes keyboard in a soft rock band in college to pay the bills. I didn’t have a large record collection—I couldn’t afford it—but the few records I had were worn through to the other side: Stravinsky, Sibelius, Mozart.\nWhen I enrolled in college I took philosophy courses, read books on aesthetics, and studied acoustics and physiology, trying to answer my question, “What does music mean?” I agreed with Aristotle, “”Rhythms and melodies contain representations of anger and mildness, and also of courage and temperance and all their opposites and other moral qualities, that most closely correspond to the true natures of these qualities…. Music has the power of producing a certain effect on the moral character of the soul.” When I considered my musical art and religion I had some of the fears shared by St. Augustine: “”Thus I float between peril of pleasure, and an\n\n\n\n\n\n\napproved profitable custom: inclined the more to allow the old usage of singing in the Church, and yet again, so often as it befalls me to be more moved with the voice than with the message, I confess myself to have grievously offended: at which time I wish rather not to have heard the music. See now in what a state I am!” I read Hermann Hesse’s Glasperlenspiel (The Glass Bead Game) and wondered how music and art meant somehow more than just the notes, rhythms, and nuances, but somehow the lattice of sounds and ideas evoked an order that was more than the sum of the parts. I was so driven by this question I wrote my masters thesis to the question, exploring structuralism and Jungian psychology to look for an answer.\nAnd on other days I sided with Felix Mendelssohn, who complained, “There is so much talk about music, and yet so little is said. For my part, I believe that words do not suffice for such a purpose.”\nThere were times when I turned to the scriptures and church leaders, as well as to my university professors, for spiritual direction in looking for my answer. I read the Psalms, early hymns of praise and worship and considered the Lord’s words in DC 25:12: “For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads.” I knew that music was important to our Heavenly Father, for in D\u0026C 136:28 I read: “If thou art merry, praise the Lord with singing, with music, with dancing, and with a prayer of praise and thanksgiving.” I remembered at the conclusion of the Last Supper, before the Lord went out to the garden, that Christ and the apostles sang a hymn.\nOne day, as I was talking with Professor Robert Manookin, a composer on the BYU faculty, he told me with some earnestness, “I wonder what heavenly choirs sound like? I hear people talk about hearing choirs in the temple, or on other sacred occasions. What did they hear?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes it sound like Brahms? Or more like Palestrina? Or is it simple four-part harmony, like in the hymnbook? What is it about that heavenly sound that is so wonderful, that carries such deep meaning into the hearts of those who hear it? That’s what I want to write!”\nSo I went off to graduate school at Columbia University to study musicology. Perhaps they could teach me what composers meant by their music. I spent days with Josquin’s breathtakingly beautiful motet, “Ave Maria, gratia plena” and Bach’s cantata, “Christ lag in Todesbanden.” I learned the poignant story of Michael Haydn’s Requiem and how it affected the young, 16-year old Mozart who played in the orchestra in 1771 and then later partially recreated the work in his own Requiem 20 years later.\nWhen I finished school I became a teacher, facing my first class of freshmen at the University of Michigan 25 years ago. I then asked myself, “What is it about music that brings them here? What does music mean for them?”\nI knew some were there because they were pushed—by parents, friends, or teachers. Some were driven by ambition to conquer the stages of Classical stardom. Most, however, I knew were there because of a more idealistic purpose, because they loved their art. These students, probably, had survived life-changing experiences like those I passed through in my childhood, sitting in the orchestra and playing the Finale from Stravinsky’s Firebird Suite— when, as the solo horn entered on top of that quiet, shimmering string tremolo, my heart skipped several beats and I knew, this is what I want to do all of my life. I could look into the eyes of most of my students and see that same fire, a meaning they carried in their heart—even if we found it impossible to express that meaning in words, exactly.\nI taught at Michigan for nine years, and then at Penn State for eight, and then came to BYU. Here I found something more than I had known. The level of music making was as high as anything I had seen elsewhere, but there was something deeper beneath the surface. I saw it in the tears of students singing of the resurrection while performing Mahler’s Second Symphony. I found it in the silent elevator I shared with two violinists who had just poured out their hearts to children in a cancer clinic in London, in the hearts of education students recently returned from teaching English through music in the orient, and in the face of an overwhelmed, shaken graduate student who, at the end of an independent readings course on music in fin-de-siécle Vienna, began weeping and cried out, “Now I understand what happened!”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat drives them also drives us. Music has meaning. It is that which brings us here to this organ workshop today. It’s message changes us, makes us better, lifts and inspires us. We want, sometimes desperately, to help others hear what we hear, to feel the same thing we do, in something like the same way.\nYou’ve come here to learn how to do that. You know that here you will find wonderful teachers who will help you with technique, share practical knowledge like registration or organ history, and explore new repertoire. Here you know you will find others like yourself who want to share and learn together. Most importantly, though, you come here in the hope of learning to communicate the meaning you find in music with others.\nYou have an obligation and even a duty to do that. As the Lord reminded Oliver Cowdery (D\u0026C 6:10), “Behold thou hast a gift, and blessed art thou because of thy gift. Remember it is sacred and cometh from above.” Each of us is given a measure, a “talent” in a literal sense, “Unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one: to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey. And all this for the benefit of the church of the living God, that every man may improve upon his talent, that every man may gain other talents, yea, even an hundred fold…” (DC 82:17-18)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo we will study and learn together, and then we will serve, lift, and inspire others. We will search for the meaning of what we do and how we can make our talent best serve others.\nWe know that technique is essential, but also that it is only a means to an end. We want to show, through music, how art can be a means in the hand of God to bless the lives, gladden the hearts, comfort the weary, and in some small way, give meaning to life.\nYears ago I was sitting alone (or so I thought) in a dimly lit chapel, playing hymns on the piano. A silent observer finally rose, came forward, and paid me one of the highest compliments I’ve ever received as a musician. She said, “When you play the hymns, I hear the meaning of those words so strong, like you are singing to my heart.” When we are able to convey the message of our art to others, that’s when we succeed, I believe.\nWelcome to BYU. I hope some of spirit of this place will help you in your quest as a musician and servant. I hope what you learn and take with you will help you express those things that you find to be most important in life and in eternity—to inspire and “Lift up the hands that hang down.” Music can do this.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t2007\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\tOn the Pursuit of Excellence\n\n\n\nAndrew E. Unsworth\n2007\nIt is an honor to be asked to speak today and to participate in this workshop. I’ve been privileged to teach several times during this week, and I’ve always come away renewed in my love of the gospel and church music and feeling grateful to be numbered among you as a laborer in the Kingdom.\nAs I’ve considered what I might talk about, my thoughts have settled on a comment President Boyd K. Packer gave in his April 2007 General Conference address. Some of his remarks are related to issues in church music with which I struggled for a number of years. I am directing my thoughts today towards LDS organists, especially those who currently play for the sacrament meetings of their wards, but the issues I’ll address exist to varying degrees in many denominations.\nPresident Packer explained how, having recently been called as a General Authority and feeling somewhat inadequate and in need of spiritual strength, he entered the back of theSaltLakeTabernacletolistentoPrimaryConference. Hedescribedthemusicheheard and the feelings it brought to him. He also recounted the approach the organist took to the accompaniment of the choir: “As the children sang quietly, the organist, who understood that excellence does not call attention to itself, did not play a solo while they sang. He skillfully, almost invisibly blended the young voices into a melody of inspiration, of revelation.”1\nI want to focus my remarks on our pursuit of excellence as organists. How do we manifest musical excellence and not call attention to ourselves? How can we strive to\n1 Boyd K. Packer, “The Spirit of the Tabernacle,” Ensign (May 2007): 26.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimprove our musical skills and still approach our service playing with humility? And, how can we improve our efforts to invite the Holy Spirit through music and facilitate revelation?\nIn many respects, it may seem counterintuitive that one might be able to be excellent and not draw attention to oneself. Doesn’t excellence by definition stand out from the ordinary? And, if the ideal performance is one that doesn’t draw undue attention to itself, why do we bother spending all of this time and money to improve our skills on the organ?\nFirst, we have to remember that there is a distinct difference between excellence and mere “flashiness.” While true greatness on the organ can be manifested in a technical exhibition, an awareness of one’s performance context is important. I do not doubt that most of you would agree that playing complicated interludes and accompaniments to hymns and virtuosic preludes and postludes is not generally appropriate for sacrament meetings. At the same time, I imagine that many of you would be disappointed if you attended an organ concert by a famous performer and heard only pieces played out of an organ method book.\nWe also need to remember that incompetence draws attention to itself as much as or more than flashiness does. We have all experienced church meetings in which an organist or pianist struggled to make it through a sacrament meeting with his or her dignity intact—and maybe sometimes that someone was us. Since we belong to a church with a lay ministry, where organists are called to their positions regardless of their previous experience, such situations are bound to happen. And this is not an issue unique to the LDS Church or the twenty-first century. We can all doubtless identify with the comments of Nathaniel Gould, a nineteenth-century American musical commentator, describing the state of organ playing in the 1830s and 40s:\nWhen the rapid introduction of organs took place, it was not so difficult to procure the organs as to provide competent organists. It was represented by those who were interested that any one might, in a short time, qualify himself to play plain psalmody; consequently, young ladies and gentlemen, old men and maidens, made the attempt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it was found not to be the work of a day, or a month, to learn to manage an organ so as to satisfy singers or hearers. Some one, perhaps, would attempt, with little experience in execution, time or harmony, the singers and organist hobbling along in sweet confusion. Complaints are made; the organist is mortified, if not provoked; stays away from church, – no organist.2\nI lived in a ward for a time where the pianist in priesthood meeting really struggled to get through hymns. This good brother was teaching himself to play the piano, but he hadn’t yet mastered the concepts of rhythm and meter—he’d add a beat here or take a beat away there. One Sunday, the brethren in the ward close to the piano were struggling to figure out where the beat lay, while the brethren on the other side of the room continued to plow ahead, singing the hymn in time. The result was utter chaos. Ultimately, the hymn disintegrated as the priesthood body burst into gales of laughter, and the hymn had to be attempted again. While mistakes and the occasional disaster are inevitable when human beings are making music, and although I’m sure many of the men present at this meeting enjoyed having a good laugh, one person’s ego was deflated, and the purpose of music in the meeting was defeated.\nThe problem that President Packer has doubtless experienced and that he implies in his comments is that some organists don’t understand that when playing in an LDS church service, one should strive to draw the attention of the congregation towards the spiritual purpose of the meeting and away from oneself. Those who haven’t figured this out yet exhibit a certain type of spiritual and artistic immaturity: as they gain skills they want to use them, and they may do so without much discrimination. This has been an issue for quite some time. John Sullivan Dwight, a venerable nineteenth-century American musical commentator, reported on a church service witnessed in New York City in 1865:\n2 Nathaniel D. Gould, Church Music in America (Boston: A. N. Johnson, 1853), 180.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[The organist] commenced to play the Old Hundred. At first, majestic as it should be, but soon his left hand began to get unruly among the bass notes, then the right cut up a few monkey shines in the treble; left threw in a large assortment of quavers; right led off with a grand flourish and a few dozen variations; left struggled mournfully to keep up, but soon gave up dead beat, and after that went back to first principles, and hammered away religiously at Old Hundred in spite of the antics of its fellow; right struck up a march–marched into a quick step–quick step into a gallop; left still kept at Old Hundred; right put in all sorts of fancy extras, to entice the left from its sense of propriety; left still unmoved; right put in a few bars of a popular waltz; left wavers a little; right strikes left still unmoved; right put in a few bars of a popular waltz; left wavers a little; right strikes up a favorite polka; left evidently yielding; right dashes into a jig; left now fairly deserts his colors and goes over to the enemy, and both commence an animated hornpipe, leaving poor Old Hundred to take care of itself. At length with a crash, a squeak, a rush, a roar, a rumble, and an expiring groan, the overture concluded and the service began.3\nOn another occasion, Dwight printed some observations on an organ postlude:\nYou may easily imagine how the closing voluntary in most cases is performed: the organist sometimes draws out every stop in his organ, and quite forgetting the place where he is playing, and only thinking of displaying the dexterity of his fingers, performs overtures, grand marches, etc.; and it has sometimes really seemed to me as though he aimed to drown the impression made by a solemn sermon, or as though he wished to express his joy that the sermon was ended.4\nAs a young man, I often used my postludes in church as a platform for testing new repertoire and displaying my technique. I remember one Sunday, playing the Widor toccata or some other flashy piece, and hearing later from a friend that an older sister in the ward sat in the back during my postlude shaking her head in dismay. At the time, my reaction was to scoff: “Ignoramus! What does she know about great music!” Another occasion, on Pentecost Sunday, I was playing the postlude to a Church Educational System fireside. Since it was Pentecost and I was feeling rather proud of my new-found knowledge of the liturgical year, I decided to play the variations from Duruflé’s Veni Creator. As I began the final toccata, a well-meaning usher came up to me and asked me to play more quietly—that people were having a hard time talking. I was incensed at the usher’s lack of respect towards\n3 Dwight’s Journal of Music 25 (22 July 1865): 72.\n4 “Church Music,” Dwight’s Journal of Music 1 (18 September 1852): 189.\n\n\n\n\n\n\na beautiful piece, but more particularly at her disregard of my preparation for the occasion and my technical capability.\nNow, with a few more years of experience under my belt, I am embarrassed about my former approach to church music. What changed my attitude? For one, I got older, and hopefully wiser. Also, I had numerous experiences with church music outside of my own tradition, and these helped me better understand the historical context of LDS church music.\nAs an undergraduate at BYU, I served for two years as the Organ Scholar at the Cathedral of the Madeleine in Salt Lake City. During graduate school, I also worked for several years as an organist and choir director at Lutheran and Baptist churches. After I received my degree, I returned to Salt Lake and spent five more years at the Cathedral of the Madeleine, serving this time as the Organist and Assistant Director of Music. Through these experiences, I gained an appreciation for other Christian denominations, their good works, sincereandbeautifulworship,andrichartistictraditions. Oneofthewonderfulpartsabout these church jobs, especially my position at the Madeleine, was to be able to perform some of the world’s finest sacred choral and organ music in the setting for which it was written. I found that experiencing this great religious art in its original context heightened my understanding of and appreciation for the composers and the situations in which they labored. After several years of living within the rhythm of the liturgical year, I acquired a sense of the function of much of this music, and it now it seems a little strange to me to sit and listen to a Mass or other sacred compositions in a secular, concert setting.\nMost American Protestant churches in the first half of the nineteenth century had an ambivalent relationship with the pipe organ. Except in the largest cities, elaborate church music and especially pipe organs were uncommon—they were seen generally as “papist” (a serious insult back in those days). Instead, most church music was congregational and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhumble, and when organs finally became more widespread in American churches, congregations and musical commentators were quite conservative in the types of organ literature they deemed appropriate for use in divine service. A reporter from Philadephia wrote in 1863:\nAmong the masters of composition a style of organ playing is recognized, called the free style; we mean that free style which has never been recognized as any part of church music. Compositions of this class are written for the organ exhibition or the concert. They have no place in church. They are light, sportive and showy. They will never predispose the mind to devotion. They were never intended to do this.5\nEugene Thayer, a well-known nineteenth-century American organist and pedagogue, went so far as to prescribe what composers’ compositions should not be played in services: “[I]t must be remembered that neither Bach nor Handel left us any organ music suitable for the introductionofchurchservice,asmostmusiciansofourdayunderstandit.”6 Nineteenth- century Americans were also well-aware how inappropriate music can destroy the spirit of a worship service:\nLight minds are pleased with trifles, and such persons forget the service they are engaged in. The true style of organ music is that which casts noble hints into the soul, not the merely pretty style, which affects no part of the head but the ear, and touches not the heart.\nA celebrated writer of a century and a half ago, says of certain organists who introduced irreligious music into their voluntaries: “These fingering gentlemen should be informed that they ought to suit their airs to the place and business; and that the musician is obliged to keep to the text as much as the preacher. For want of this, I have found by experience a great deal of mischief; for, when the preacher has often, with great piety and art enough, handled his subject, and I have found in myself, and in the rest of the pew, good thoughts and dispositions, they have been all in a moment dissipated by a jig from the organ-loft.”7\nOut of this context sprang our early LDS musical practice: it did not include organ music at all in the beginning, and the great choral and organ works do not belong to it. I’m\n5 “How They Play the Organ in Church,” The Monthly Choir and Organ Journal 1 (May 1863): 97-98.\n6 Eugene Thayer, “Service Preludes,” The Organist’s Quarterly Journal and Review 1 (July 1874): 3.\n7 James Hewins, Hints Concerning Church Music (Boston: A. Williams \u0026 Co., 1857), 33.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnot saying, as Thayer did, that one can’t play Bach or Handel in church; in my opinion, however, if we play “classical” or art music from outside our own tradition in sacrament meeting, we must be aware that we are bringing in a foreign element, and we should do so with the utmost care. How do we decide when it is appropriate to do so? This is where we need to use our keenest spiritual sensitivity and best communication skills. We should talk to our priesthood leaders and ascertain their vision for music in worship service. Even if the minds of our leaders are so consumed by other matters that music is the least of their worries, we should, in my opinion, do all in our power to retain or regain their trust—to insure that music never becomes a concern for them.\nSo if the organ repertoire I am learning is generally not appropriate for use in a sacrament meeting, why should I bother practicing it? Well, it’s great art, and great art uplifts and edifies, often regardless of the context in which it is experienced. Some of my most powerful spiritual experiences through music have occurred in the solitude of a practice room. But the natural man can be lazy, and I often need more motivation than that. I have learned that nothing gets me to the practice room or church as frequently as knowledge that I’ll be playing a piece in public in the near future. I strongly encourage you to cultivate performance opportunities in contexts in addition to sacrament meeting. Arrange for a ward or stake hymnsing, give a solo or group recital, get involved with your local AGO chapter. You’ll find that great music is even more satisfying when performed in the appropriate context.\nSometimes problems arise when our hearts are right, but our intentions are misunderstood, and even here, the blame can often be placed squarely on our own shoulders. As we grow in ability, our congregations grow with us, becoming accustomed to more registral variety, varied harmonies, and generally more skilful playing. Problems may\n\n\n\n\n\n\narise if, say, one is called to be an organist in a ward where one has never served before. If I were to show up in an unfamiliar congregation, and give every hymn “the treatment” (in the words of Gerre Hancock), altering harmony, adding non-harmonic tones, and including elaborate interludes, even if it were a festive occasion and my intentions were pure, my hymn playing would doubtless be interpreted as a prideful display, and it would be distracting to the congregation. To avoid being misunderstood when one is new to a congregation, it would be wise to exercise extreme restraint in one’s playing at first, and, after consultation with one’s bishop, gradually introduce the congregation to some of the hymn playing techniques you’ll learn about this week.\nOf course, we should seek after anything that is lovely, of good report, or praiseworthy. But when we seek to gratify our pride or vain ambition through our performance in sacrament meeting, we lose the spirit, and we are no longer playing for the right reasons. Can you not imagine the pleasure that the Lord must take in organists who create an atmosphere conducive to revelation through their humble service? And can you not imagine the pleasure (and, yes, revelations) that such organists receive as they approach their performance in sacrament meeting in this manner, combining technical proficiency, modesty, and meekness. I know many of you have already experienced this.\nI’m not arguing for a dumbing-down of LDS church music. Instead, I’m acknowledging that all great music has a place, and for historical and cultural reasons, we must choose with special care what music we play in church services and how we approach our hymn playing. I recognize how difficult it is to retain motivation to practice and strive for excellence when mediocrity is tolerated in and even celebrated by popular culture. Your presence here today demonstrates a desire to rise above the mire, and for this I admire and applaud you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI want to draw your thoughts to a day a month or so in the future. The glow with which you will leave this workshop will have departed by then. You may be somewhat discouraged at lack of progress or practice time, or you may feel unappreciated. Practicing the organ can be a lonely, solitary affair, and most of us have to go to a cold, dark church to rehearse (there’s a reason why organists tend to be such strange people). In spite of your efforts to improve the quality of music in your ward, people may continue to talk through your preludes and postludes, and doubtless few will appreciate your subtleties of registration, articulation, and smooth legato. But please know that your efforts in the service of the Lord are important and they are noticed. They are important because they demonstrate your commitment to the Lord and your desire to serve Him to the best of your ability. And regardless of how you may feel at times, your efforts are noticed—and not just by the angels. I have had the experience on multiple occasions, as I’m sure many of you have had, that even the most unmusical ward member will be aware from the first Sunday you play that something is different, even if all you do is play the hymns straight through as written with good legato, well-articulated repeated notes, and appropriate registration. And what is not excellentaboutthat? Isthereanyshameinplayingwell,evenifyouareplayingsomething simple? Success in any venture demands our best efforts, especially when we venture to serve the Lord.\nTo conclude, I’d like to return to President Packer’s conference talk. President Packer described the spiritual experience he had at Primary Conference as the organist played and the choir sang as a “defining moment . . . [that] fixed deeply and permanently in mysoulthatwhichImostneededtosustainmeintheyearstofollow.”8 Ifwestriveto perfect our organ technique and to approach our performance in sacrament meeting\n8 Packer, 26.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nremembering, as President Packer said, that music “cannot be separated from the voice of the Lord, the quiet, still voice of the Spirit,” your ward members will remember how they felt and the testimony they gained as they sang the hymns of Zion to your accompaniment. And most importantly, the giver of all gifts will make you a “ruler over many things,” as you enter into the joy of our Lord.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t2008\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\tControlling Our Thoughts\n\n\n\nKeynote Address by Parley L. Belnap\nAugust 5, 2008\nThe Lord has given us our agency, which is necessary for our growth and development. We are accountable, not only for our actions and words, but also for our thoughts and we must accept the consequences for our choices. Thanks to the atonement of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, we are not locked in to past unacceptable choices. The scriptures emphasize these points many times. In Proverbs we read: “For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he.” (Proverbs 23:7)\nPresident James E. Faust gave a wonderful sermon on the power of self-mastery at the General Conference Priesthood Session in April 2000:\nEvery human soul . . . has the challenge of controlling his or her thoughts, appetites, speech, temper, desires. . . I now turn to mastery of our own private thoughts. In this realm, conscience is the only referee that can blow the whistle when we get out of control. If not bridled, our thoughts can run wild. Our minds are a part of us that really require discipline and control. [President James E. Faust, “The Power of Self-Mastery,” Ensign, May 2000]\nIn the book But I Played It Perfectly in the Practice Room, we read:\nWhen we internalize the fact that we become what we think, we are more encouraged to consider our thoughts, and explore the many possibilities and options that may be actualized in us. [Charlotte Sibley Whitaker, Donald Ray Tanner; But I Played It Perfectly in the Practice Room; (Lanham, Maryland 20706: University Press of America, 1987), p. 56.]\nSo critical is it that we understand the necessity of controlling our thoughts that President Spencer W. Kimball devoted a whole chapter to it in his book The Miracle of Forgiveness. [Spencer W. Kimball, The Miracle of Forgiveness, Chapter 8, “As a Man Thinketh,” (Salt Lake City: Bookcraft, 1969)]\nIn Galatians 6:7-8 we read: “Be not deceived; God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. He that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.”\nIn LDS Hymn 216, we find the following:\nWe are sowing, daily sowing Countless seeds of good and ill, By a whisper sow we blessings, By a breath we scatter strife,\nIn our words and thoughts and actions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLie the seeds of death and life.\nThe scientific as well as the medical world emphasizes the strong unity and correlation between the mind and body. A poem I have heard frequently clearly tells the relationship and importance of our thoughts:\nSow a thought and you reap an act; Sow an act and you reap a habit;\nSow a habit and you reap a character; Sow a character and you reap a destiny.\nWilliam James wrote, “The greatest revolution of my life is the discovery that individuals can change the outer aspects of their lives by changing the inner attitudes of their minds.”\nBrian Tracy states:\nYour thoughts vividly imagined and repeated, charged with emotion, become your reality. Almost everything you have in your life has been created by your own thinking.\nPut another way, thoughts are things. They take on a life of their own. First you have them, then they have you. You act in a manner consistent with what you are thinking about most of the time. You eventually become what you think about. And if you change your thinking you change your life. . .The one thing you must do is to create the mental equivalent of what you want to experience in reality. [Brian Tracy, Maximum Achievement, (New York City: Simon and Schuster, 1993),\np. 56.]\nGreat emphasis is put on positive thinking and positive attitudes as a major part in overcoming illness, personal problems, developing good marriage relationships, developing good work relationships, preventing problems and promoting health. Textbooks, scientific books, and self-help books have been written in the past twenty or so years on relaxing, mental practicing, overcoming stage fright, and preventing overuse problems of the hands and arms. There is great emphasis on retraining the mind by retraining and controlling our thoughts.\nRegarding controlling our thoughts in our performances, let me tell you some of my personal challenges. But first I will give a brief introduction to my developing an interest in music. As a child my thoughts, desires and interests were beginning to be channeled into music. When I was nine years old, I started piano lessons with my Aunt Mabel Belnap in my hometown of Hooper, Utah. I loved the piano and loved to practice.\nMy introduction to performing in church began when I was twelve years old and I was ordained a deacon. Bishop Levi Beus was bishop of the Hooper Ward of the Weber Stake in Weber County, west of Ogden, Utah. He called me to play the piano for priesthood meeting. I had been taking piano lessons from my Aunt for three years. I enjoyed this calling. I even made my own piano arrangement of Come, Come Ye Saints, which seemed to please the priesthood leaders and members. I suppose I did it for the 24th of July one year.\nWhen I was a teenager, KSL radio broadcast 15 minutes each weekday of the half-hour noon recitals of the Tabernacle Organ on Temple Square. When I was out of school during the summers, I listened faithfully to these broadcasts. It was a wonderful introduction to the organ for me and I truly learned to love its sound. I also listened Sunday evenings to a radio program called “Sunday Evening on Temple Square”––a broadcast of a half-hour organ recital by Alexander Schreiner and also Frank W. Asper. I also regularly listened to a radio broadcast of E. Power Biggs playing the organ from the Harvard Germanic Museum in Boston, Massachusetts. So my interest and love for the organ was being developed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was blessed with two fine piano teachers who prepared me well for a later choice to be an organist. I had many opportunities to accompany choirs, soloists, and play the piano with the Weber High School Orchestra and at Weber College in Ogden. I started organ lessons when I was a junior at BYU, where I was one of the piano accompanists for the major choirs. I loved music and the opportunity to serve.\nSometime later I was blessed with a scholarship from the Belgian-American Educational Foundation to study for two years with Flor Peeters at the Royal Flemish Conservatory in Antwerp, Belgium.\nAt the end of my second year, I was working toward a diploma in organ performance at the Conservatory. I would like to relate to you a personal experience which shows inadequate control of my thoughts:\nI had to prepare two examinations, one exam being a recital program. The jury consisted of 5 judges from the conservatories of Belgium and Holland. One of the pieces I played was the Chorale in E Major by Cesar Franck.. I was playing well and when I got to the last page, I congratulated myself and was thinking “you have played this piece without a mistake—just one page to go.” Pride goeth before the fall. Ten measures from the end I goofed in a pedal passage. I was devastated but was still awarded the diploma with honors. So it is a mistake to congratulate yourself before it is over. I didn’t keep my thoughts focused until the end. This work lasts 15 minutes and I didn’t endure to the end. My advice is “control your thoughts; it isn’t over until it is actually over.” I have learned much from this experience.\nIn performing, it is so easy to worry and wonder when you will make a mistake. Perhaps you think of some fine musician in the audience and what he or she will be thinking. This is disruptive to you and your performance. We need to recreate the music, keeping focused on the joy of making beautiful music for the edification of our fellowmen and for the glory of God. If we allow worries to come into our thoughts, they could well become a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nPrepare well and trust your preparation. Think ahead somewhat, think in larger units, avoid worry, but trust. Mental rehearsal and controlling your thinking will be a stabilizing source for your performance. Avoid the fear of making a mistake. It will cause you to have a problem.\nFlor Peeters, my teacher at the Royal Flemish Conservatory, told me that I needed to practice more at my table, meaning to practice mentally. Because I was on a scholarship, I was practicing 6 to 8 hours a day but needed to practice more effectively. He said that I should go through the music in my mind with my thoughts, visualizing the music and recreating it mentally. I determined to practice consistently both physically and mentally. The results were amazing. I felt I had learned the music in half the time. In addition, my performance was more secure and with much less mind wandering.\n\n\n\n\nThe principle of mental practicing is a regular and important part of sports training, as well as other performance-related activities. This clearly emphasizes the point that controlling our thoughts is a major part of controlling our actions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Germans have a saying, “We cannot prevent the birds from flying overhead, but we can prevent them from nesting in our hair.” This means that we can’t always control the thoughts that enter the mind, but we can control whether or not we let them stay.\nVicktor Frankl was a neurologist, a psychiatrist, and a very wealthy man in Vienna when the Nazis took over. He spent several years of his life in concentration camps, surviving unspeakable atrocities at the hands of his captors. In his book Man’s Search for Meaning, Vicktor Frankl writes:\nThe experience of camp life shows that man does have a choice of action. There were enough examples, often of a heroic nature, which proved that apathy could be overcome, irritability suppressed. Man can preserve a vestige of spiritual freedom, of independence of mind, even in such terrible conditions of psychic and physical stress. There is sufficient proof that everything can be taken from man but one thing: the last of human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s way. [Vicktor Frankl, Man’s Search for Meaning (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1939), pp. 103-104]\nWe are challenged by the Lord, Latter-day prophets and apostles and leaders to control our thoughts. Scientific research has emphasized the importance of the mind/body relationship. Medical research indicates the importance of controlling our thoughts, attitudes, and feelings as an important factor in a healthy life style. Sport leaders and other performance-area leaders stress the importance of the mind in relaxation, skill achievement, and performance. In fact, mental rehearsal is advocated in order to prevent and overcome overuse problems of the hands, arms, legs and general body. It is a help in concentration and a preventative for mind wandering in any type of performance. So controlling and channeling our thoughts is very important—how we engage the mind in what we do.\nBoyd K. Packer states,\n“Probably the greatest challenge to people of any age, particularly young people, and the most difficult thing you will face in mortal life it to learn to control your thoughts. “As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.” (Proverbs 23:7) One who can control his thoughts has conquered himself. [Boyd K. Packer, “Inspiring Music–Worthy Thoughts,” Ensign, January 1974, p. 25]\nIn Doctrine and Covenants 38: 30, we read, “If ye are prepared ye shall not fear.” Your preparation gives stability and the ability to perform well and consistently. You will perform generally how you practice. Some practical things I have learned for performance may be of help to you:\n\nPlan your fingering and pedaling; write enough in your music so you can be consistent each time\nPractice slowly and carefully. Learn each part by itself with consistent fingering and pedaling. Use 7-step and or 15-step method of practice.\nSee music in groups, units, motives, and phrases; do not play note by note.\nAnalyze form, melodic structure, and cadences. Think music in larger units–compare toreading sentences, even paragraphs.\nUse mental practice as well as physical practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Practice for 25 minutes and then take a five-minute break. This will help you avoid overuse and help you avoid mind wandering in performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Keep your mind active and alert as you practice. See patterns in music; notice repetitions, musical shapes, cadences, etc. Discover all you can about the music you play.\n8. Avoid mindless repetitions; it will help you avoid mind wandering when you perform. 9. Plan your practice; set realistic goals for each practice session.\nIn the book But I Played it Perfectly in the Practice Room by Whitaker and Tanner, we read:\nRecent research has produced amazing results in determining that an extremely large amount of our responses are directly related to the attitudes and thoughts within our mind. [Whitaker and Tanner, But I Played it Perfectly in the Practice Room, p. 37.]\nPresident Ezra Taft Benson has stated:\nThe Lord said, “Look unto me in every thought.” (D\u0026C 6:36) Looking to the Lord in every thought is the only possible way we can be the manner of men and women we ought to be.\nThe Lord asked the question of His disciples, “ What manner of men ought ye to be?” He answered his own question by saying, “Even as I am” (3 Nephi 27:27) To become as He is, we must have Him on our mind—constantly in our thoughts. Every time we partake of the Sacrament, we commit to “always remember Him.”\nIf thoughts make us what we are, and we are to be like Christ, then we must think Christlike thoughts. Let me repeat that: if thoughts make us what we are and we are to be like Christ, we must think Chrislike thoughts.\nPaul, en route to Damascus to persecute the Saints, saw a light from Heaven and heard the voice of the Lord. Then Paul asked a simple eight-word question—and the persistent asking of the same question changed his life. “Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?” (Acts 9:6) The persistent asking of that same question can change your life. There is no greater question that you can ask in this world. “Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?” [President Ezra Taft Benson of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, “Think on Christ,” Ensign, April 1984, p. 9]\nA wonderful example of obedience to this thought, “Lord, what wilt thou have me do,” is the following story of Clara Neu, which I have permission to use. Quoting Sister Neu’s own words:\nMy maiden name was Clara Grover Tilton, and I was at Syracuse University from the fall of 1956 to June of 1960, when I graduated with a BM in organ performance, summa cum laude and also received the Outstanding Music Student Award of the year. Dr. Poister, who never wanted to be called that, only Mr. Poister, was my teacher every semester except one, when he went on sabbatical. I was very blessed that way – I had no idea when I auditioned for him and asked him whether, if I came to Syracuse University, he would be my teacher, that he really didn’t teach undergraduate students anymore. He assured me at that time that he would teach me, and so it was.\n\n\n\n\nMay I interject that Arthur Poister is considered by many to have been one of the greatest organ teachers of the world. In 1979 at BYU he gave the last master class of his life. Continuing Sister Neu’s story:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy study with Anton Heiller in Vienna, Austria, began in the fall of 1960 on a Fulbright Scholarship and lasted until spring of the next year.\nAgain, parenthetically, Anton Heiller had an international reputation, with students coming from all over the world to study with him. Continuing with Sister Neu’s words:\nBrother Ray Arbizu, a voice teacher from BYU, was on a Fulbright Scholarship in the same group as myself. Heavenly Father saw to it, frankly, that I was quite humbled at the time and looking for an anchor in my life. I had been a Methodist. I joined that church at junior high school age in order to participate in the choir program, and because I was studying organ and piano with the Methodist organist, John Ferris, who later became the university organist at Yale University.\nI had a childhood testimony of Jesus Christ, but did not have more than that inside. A fellow Fulbrighter, Ann Alberts and I went at Ann’s instigation to see Marion and Ray Arbizu. Ann had said that if anyone could help me at that point in my life, it would be the Arbizus. They taught us the gospel with tears in their eyes, until 2:00 am.with young children wailing to be put to bed. I felt something different and remarkable in the Arbizu apartment. The Holy Spirit bore abundant and generous witness to me that what I was hearing was true, and I needed to do something about it. The Arbizus gave Ann and me a Book of Mormon, but Ann would not let me have it at first, saying that I had not read enough in the Bible. So I commenced there, and soon got the chance to read in the Book of Mormon. Also, Ray and Marion gave us a copy of “The Articles of Faith” by James Talmage. I read that also from cover to cover and checked out every single footnote in the scriptures…. It all added up.\nAnn and I went back to the Arbizus and Ray asked if we would like to come to church. We did, and it was very nice. I was impressed by the simplicity—there was no chapel in Vienna in 1961, and we met in a rented room over an auto-body shop. But the spirit of sincerity was strong, and I found it without frills, but honest and good.\nRay Arbizu finally asked if we would like meet with the missionaries, and I remember saying to him, “Well, is that how we get in?” On our first meeting, one of the elders said to us that if we would read the Book of Mormon, we would come to know that it was true. I remember replying that I already knew it was true. He then looked quickly at his companion and said he would like us to prepare to be baptized. We were both baptized (and are both still active in the church) in a swimming pool, the Deanabad, by Ray Arbizu himself on 17 January 1961. . . For me the story becomes a little more difficult at that point. I wrote a letter home to my parents telling them that I was investigating the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The next letter that I wrote home was to tell them that I had been baptized. Mother came as quickly as she could to talk me out of that commitment. She….was determined that I should not continue as a Mormon, and was unwilling to listen to anyone’s defenses. And so with this battle raging, my study shortly ended in Vienna. We came home and continued the fight.\nI had been accepted at Union Theological Seminary as an organ student candidate for the Master of Sacred Music degree, planning before my joining this church to be a protestant organist and choirmistress and went there that fall. I completed the degree but felt that my organ teacher, Vernon de Tar, resented my new found religion. My mother had a confrontational interview at one point during those two years at Union with the Dean of Students as to why no one had been able to turn my mind back to being a Protestant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Schreiner, Alexander Schreiner’s son, brought her to church the first time she went to the Manhattan Ward in New York City. Clara met Robert Neu there and began a courtship. They married August 3, 1963, in the Manhattan Ward and were sealed two weeks later in the Swiss Temple. Their seven children were born in New York. Clara Neu decided to direct her efforts eventually to her family and gave up her position in the Christian Science Church at Red Bank. Sister Neu remembers not wanting to have conflict and questions from their children as to why Mother went somewhere else to church. She decided that she was going to go where her family went and where she wanted them to be; so she closed the chapter of trying to be a professional church organist.\nBack to Sister Neu’s own words:\nAll five of our sons have served missions. All five of our children’s marriages so far have been temple marriages. We have been active in the church all the time. We have prioritized Church participation in our lives, feeling that the gospel and the church were of paramount importance, and if we could do other things also, it would be fine, but nothing at the expense of the first. I feel that we have been greatly blessed.\nOur missions here in London are a delight. This is the first mission we have served. Robert is truly the office boy, and enjoys it. I run the concert series at the Hyde Park Chapel. Our first concert of the Winter Series was 17 January 2008, and we just had the last one, an organ concert 2 August 2008 by Ruth Eldredge. It was lovely. My calling is also to teach organ and piano. I have three or four active organ students and about 40 piano students. I have some real young children, some teenagers and then quite a few adults. All are beginning to intermediate level. . . I do think this work is worthwhile.\nThe Lord knows us, our talents, our needs, and our thoughts and desires. If we keep our thoughts pure and directed to do His will he will be able to use us in the great Latter-day work, as he is using Sister Neu. What a great blessing for her, Brother Neu, and for others in London, England! What a wonderful example of a person acting on righteous thoughts and impressions!\nControlling our thoughts blesses various aspects of our lives–from the practical to the spiritual. In the words of Elder Boyd K Packer, “I have come to know that thoughts, like water, will stay on its course if we make a place for them to go.” [Elder Boyd K. Packer, “Inspiring Music–Worthy Thoughts,” Ensign, January, 1974, p. 25]\nEspecially, may our thoughts be of Christ, and may we strive to be more like him, love and serve Him with all our heart, soul, and mind, and always remember Him.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t2009\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\nPoco a poco\nKeynote Address by Bonnie L. Goodliffe\nAugust 4, 2009\nI am humbled at the prospect of speaking to you today. I pray that I may say something helpful to each of you.\nI was in my senior year at BYU when this building first opened. I walked by the construction site almost every day before it was completed. I spent three additional years roaming these halls as a graduate student. I have many sweet memories tied to this building Most of the special faculty members that I knew are gone now. Even people I went to school with who were on the faculty are retired now. People younger than I am are running the department. This continues to astonish me. I still think of myself as being about 29, maybe 31.\nI feel that I have been very fortunate to have been in the right place at the right time to have had the experiences that I have had. I have had excellent teachers, indispensable family encouragement and support, wonderful mentors, and unlikely opportunities. I never expected to be able to spend so much time in musical activities. I have, for some reason, been given the chance to do many of the things that I would have thought to be impossible\nI believe that one of the things which has made these experiences possible is my topic today. Let me illustrate with three seemingly unrelated items. I hope you will see the connection by the time I finish this talk, or I will be very embarrassed.\n#1 Some years ago I read a Dear Abby column which had a great influence on me. It must have affected many others too, judging by the letters which were printed as a result. The column has been re-printed numerous times It deals with a decision to go to medical school, but that is irrelevant here.\n“Dear Abby: I am a 36-year-old college dropout whose lifelong ambition was to be a physician. I have a very good job selling pharmaceutical supplies, but my heart is still in the practice of medicine. I do volunteer work at the local hospital on my time off, and people tell me I would have been a wonderful doctor.\n“If I go back to college and get my degree, then go to medical school, do my internship and finally get into the practice of medicine, it will take me seven years. But Abby, in seven years I will be 43 years old! What do you think?\n(Signed) “Unfulfilled in Philly”\n(She answers) “Dear Unfulfilled: And how old will you be in seven years if you don’t do it?”\n\n\n\nMy Dear Brothers and Sisters,\n\n\n\n\nPage 1 of 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#2 Years ago I saw an article in the newspaper about making lists to accomplish certain goals. Since I am a professional-caliber list maker, this appealed to me in a big way. Here is the gist: make a list of 100 things you want to do. (This is harder than you might think.) They can be things to buy, places to go, projects to complete, whatever. Then start working on them. Cross off each item as you complete it, and replace it with a new goal. I have my list in a spiral notebook, with 25 lines to a sheet. I draw a single line through the listing and date it when I complete an item, so I have a record of what I have done. Then I use that number for a new item. I, of course, have made several sub-lists grouping my 100 things into categories such as simple purchases, large-scale travel, household improvements, things which require time but no money, that sort of thing. One of the sub-categories I call “poco a poco – things which can be done a little at a time.”\n#3 1993 was the centennial year of the Salt Lake Temple. As you may know, it took 40 years to build. I never doubted this fact; I just didn’t consider the implications. During that centennial year, the temple construction was talked about at General Conference, written about in church magazines and various other books, documented in a special church motion picture, and featured in a wonderful exhibit at the church museum of history and art. Some of the details of the building problems finally made me realize what a stupendous project the temple was. I was stunned to learn that the entire foundation had to be dug up and re-done after the episode with Johnson’s Army. Cracks were found which necessitated virtually starting over. Elder Boyd K. Packer’s conference talk that April related that it took an ox team approximately one week to leave the Salt Lake Valley, arrive at the granite quarry, load one single block of granite, and travel back to the temple site in Salt Lake City. One week if nothing went wrong. If there were problems, of course it took longer than one week. I’m afraid that I would have found the situation so discouraging that I would have just given up on the whole thing. I would have said, “this is hopeless; we won’t live long enough to see this temple built.” Or “what a crazy idea; any realistic person can see that this is just a pipedream.” Fortunately for the church, I wasn’t there. Fortunately a prophet was in charge, a prophet who wasn’t limited by what was reasonable, or logical, or possible within an allotted time period. He just had the vision. And a mere forty years later, the temple was completed.\nNow to bring these three ideas together. I had realized that large-scale projects, including musical ones, could be effectively worked on a little at a time, but I had applied the concept only to known, near-term performances. I hadn’t envisioned how effective the idea could be with long-term musical goals.\nI belong to a group which calls itself the Piano Club. It was in existence long before I moved to Salt Lake City, and I am one of the younger members. It is an informal group of ladies who meet once a month during the school year and perform for each other. Sometimes, and by some people, the performances are very polished; some are less polished. We try things out on each other, sometimes before we are actually ready. Over the years I have played an assortment of things, mostly dredged up from my student days. But in 1985, the Bach year, I decided to revive the Bach B flat partita, which I like very much and which I had performed in high school. Many years before. I did just one movement each month. I really wasn’t practicing the piano much at the time. I enjoyed it so much, I decided to learn the second partita, which I had never completed. Then I did the third. And so on. So, in the spring of 1992 I realized that I had learned all six partitas and the overture in the French style. I hadn’t really set out to do that; it just sort of happened. But it was like a revelation to me. One of my musical life goals was to\n\n\n\n\nPage 2 of 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlearn all the partitas. I hadn’t really conceived of how or when that might happen. It was just a nebulous idea out there in space. But there it was, suddenly, done.\nI did the French Suites next. Since that time, I have also completed the Well- tempered Clavier, Book 1; the Goldberg Variations; and the English suites. I am now working on the Well-tempered Clavier, Book 2.\nNow it seems like almost nothing to learn just one movement of a Bach partita. Okay, that is an overstatement; a few of them are long and quite difficult, but most are just one or two pages. It is no gigantic accomplishment to learn one movement in a month. But the cumulative effect was remarkable to me. When I realized that I would complete the set, I thought of Abby’s answer. How old would I have been in 1992 if I hadn’t learned all the Bach partitas. I thought, “How many other musical things can I work on this way? How many non-musical things can I work on this way?” I came up with a long list (and sub-lists, of course.)\nYou may think that you are not interested in this type of commitment. But remember there is no penalty for not accomplishing all that you hope for. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Count only the successful efforts, and forget the rest. The times you miss do not lessen the accomplishments of the past or the future. Close the door on any past lapses or failures, and move forward from wherever you are. You don’t have to commit never to miss a practice session in order to have practicing pay off for you.\nOngoing diligence will improve your abilities. Whatever your musical circum- stances, you can learn new things. Look for instance at the 1985 hymnbook. Are you familiar with all the newer things in it, or is it still like the sealed portion of the golden plates to you? Could you learn one new hymn or mark one pedal part every month?\nHow old will you be in 5 years if you don’t make such an effort? If you don’t use any initiative in your music calling? If you just squeak by week after week, collecting ideas and possibilities, but never applying them. The days and months and years will pass by just the same. But, one step a week or even one a month adds up to a fair distance down the road after a while. The cumulative effect can be impressive. But it does require a decision to make the effort, a decision about what direction to take.\nI have long been inspired by a statement of Elder Neal Maxwell’s. He wrote, “eternal things are always done in the process of time. . . . Direction is initially more important than speed.” (Of One Heart. Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1975, p.35) At least most of the time, try to be going in the right direction. I also like to remind myself of Alma’s admonition “by small and simple things are great things brought to pass.” (Alma 37:6)\nWith regard to inching forward in the right direction, I hope you will allow me to share some things I have learned about preparation and attitude.\nI believe very strongly in careful preparation of your music. Thorough preparation is probably my best skill. It has saved me on many occasions. I know that if I work through every conceivable problem mentally, beforehand, I can overcome or eliminate the great majority of problems. I can even overcome a certain amount of performance anxiety ahead of time.\nKeep in mind that thorough preparation cannot be forced. I like this comment by the violinist Itzhak Perlman: “If you learn something fast you often forget it just as fast.\n\n\n\n\nPage 3 of 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou need to give it time, let yourself grow with it, let it become a part of you. I don’t like practicing under pressure. I like to give a piece about a year, doing ten minutes here, twenty minutes there, letting the whole thing mature organically.” (“All Play is Work” (an interview with Itzhak Perlman by Jeremy Siepmann) BBC Music Magazine, May 1995, p. 22) Perlman refers to this as the “baking” method – putting something in the oven and coming back later when it’s ready to take out. A slow process, much like building the Salt Lake Temple one granite block at a time.\nIn your performances, do not rely on your emotions. Emotion is not a legitimate substitute for technical skill. Do not rely on inspiration. The Lord can magnify your abilities but not if you have done nothing first. Remember that Nephi asked the Lord where to go to find ore. He didn’t ask the Lord to drop a set of ship-building tools into his tent. Even in church service, the angels may attend you, but they do not practice for you.\nI have a philosophy about working in church music which has been very successful for me. It is this: Take all the blame yourself. Never accuse anyone else of causing poor results. If your choir director never gives you music ahead of time, perhaps you could say to him or her, “I wish I had the skills to be able to do justice to this without so much practice, but I am so far just unable to do it.” If you don’t get the hymns ahead of time, offer to choose them yourself. Offer to come to the music director’s house to pick up the schedule. Ask which day you should telephone to find out what the music will be. If the musical numbers are inadequate or inappropriate, offer to line up some better ones. Don’t complain unless you are prepared to do something constructive to improve the situation. Do everything in your power to be a positive influence: on the quality of the music, on the quality of the presentation, on the testimonies of those you work with, and on the spirituality of the worship service. Remember that sometimes the most positive thing you can do is keep quiet.\nI would like to tell you two stories. True stories. A prominent citizen passed away. An equally prominent organist was asked to provide music at the funeral services. The organist arrived at the chapel, inspected the instrument, and declared it inadequate. The organist played the piano instead. I think this is a very sad story. I can hardly imagine any justification for such arrogance. I think it is a terrible insult to the grieving family. I have played some pretty poor instruments myself. I have played funeral music which I thought was quite inappropriate. But, I say, if the family wants it and the bishop approves it, then who am I to dictate to them? I have played – at funerals – The Stars and Stripes Forever, When the Saints Go Marchin’ In, and even Help Me Make it Through the Night. Don’t think that you are too good to play a particular instrument or a piece of music. Pride is a sin much worse than musical ignorance.\nThe second story happened to me. I took my organ shoes to a shoe repair shop to have the suede soles glued back on. I explained to the young woman who was helping me that I was an organist and the significance of the suede soles. She actually seemed rather interested. Finally she said, “Have you ever played anyplace really big? Like a baseball game?” I smiled and said, “No, I’m sorry. I guess I haven’t.”\nIf you find yourself thinking that you are quite accomplished, or quite important, or at least superior to those with less training and taste, remember the shoe repair shop. It will bring you back to reality.\nOn one of my morning walks I was thinking about this talk and about goals and accomplishments and what was really possible in this lifetime. I had this bizarre idea.\n\n\n\n\nPage 4 of 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if, in the next life, I don’t get to work on all the things that I have been putting off until then. What if I get there, and there is a rule that I can only continue to work on projects that I have already started. What if I can’t begin anything brand new? What would happen if I protested and showed a long list of all the music I was planning to learn and all the skills I was planning to develop and the gatekeeper angel asked for some evidence that those things are truly important to me. I am going to feel pretty terrible about all those things I didn’t even try to accomplish–all those things on my list of 100 that just got shelved until I had that mythical chunk of free time. I am comforted to know that the Lord knows my heart and my mind, but what do my actions show?\nI have for many years loved Robert Frost’s poem “The Road Not Taken”. I like it even more since I learned Randall Thompson’s musical setting of the text, which I played on my very first broadcast of Music and the Spoken Word in 1988. I would like to share it with you in closing.\nTwo roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry I could not travel both\nAnd be one traveler, long I stood\nAnd looked down one as far as I could To where it bent in the undergrowth;\nThen took the other, as just as fair,\nAnd having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same,\nAnd both that morning equally lay\nIn leaves no step had trodden black. Oh, I kept the first for another day!\nYet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back.\nI shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and I– I took the one less traveled by,\nAnd that has made all the difference.\n(A Pocket Book of Robert Frost’s Poems, p.223. New York: Washington Square Press, Inc., 1963.)\nFor me, and perhaps for many of you, church music in general and playing the organ in particular have become the road taken, and it has made all the difference. I wish you success in all your musical ambitions, and I am grateful that we are travelling companions on that road.\nBonnie L. Goodliffe August 4, 2009\n\n\n\n\nPage 5 of 5\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t2010\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\nIt isn’t anything like mine, But, God has a plan!\nKeynote Address by Mike Ohman\nAugust 3, 2010\nI ask your forgiveness as I speak to you today. I have felt prompted to share some very personal experiences.\nA few months ago, Elder David A. Bednar gave a moving talk to the missionaries at the MTC. His message was simple. He asked a very stimulating question, “How does one recognize the Spirit?”\n“You will succeed as you learn to follow the Spirit, and, learn to understand the Holy Ghost and how He works.\nSo, he said, How do YOU recognize the Spirit?\nThe answer is simple and direct. Now, listen carefully, he said.\nQuit stewing about it.\nQuit Fussing.\nQuit worrying.\nJust be good boys and girls. Just be worthy.\nSometime you will look back and see that you were in the right place at the right time. And you will recognize that you were prompted and directed.\nI have seen so many wonderful people who are paralyzed by not having an immediate prompting to be guided. . . .NOW! Should I get married, should I go to school, should I buy this car, or should I do this thing?\nMost of us just need to press forward. Take that step in the dark, make that leap of faith.”\nI was raised in a home filled with music. My mother was a good pianist and my father was an untrained vocalist and drummer. Together, when they got on the dance floor, others would move aside to watch them “cut a rug”.\nMy earliest musical memories are of sitting on the piano bench next to my mother as she played and I learned to sing the Primary Songs, and little folk songs of the day. She taught me the notes and I began to experiment with the piano. Some of my fondest musical memories are of playing piano duets with my mother.\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn my pre-teen age years, Dad and I often worked together in our garden. Most mundane jobs were done to music. It had rhythm and tempo. Those important elements were used to advantage. Planting potatoes was accompanied by “I’ve been working on the railroad! Or, “Won’t You Come Home, Bill Bailey?” It was in this setting that I learned to harmonize.\nAt age 12 Mom took me to the church and taught me how to turn on the Hammond organ and how to work the drawbars. In a few weeks I was called as the ward organist. When I was 16, my parents bought a Hammond Organ and I began private lessons with Gene Halliday in Ogden. At 18, I graduated from high school with a four year scholarship, a gold watch as outstanding musician, and had made a commercial organ recording.\nImmediately after graduation, my family moved to Northern California and I was hired by the Hammond Organ Company to demonstrate new models for dealers on the West coast.\nAt 19, I was called to serve in the West Mexican Mission and came to the Language Training Mission at BYU for Spanish training. I dislocated my shoulder and had to go home for surgery. My mission was then transferred and I served in the Western States Mission, headquartered in Denver, Colorado. While there, I fell in a rather unkempt shower and tore the previous surgery apart. I went home for a second, more radical operation on my shoulder. Many weeks later, I returned to Denver. Baptisms were scarce in those years. My one experience was with Paul Rudolph, a Tlinket Indian . . . we call them Eskimos. I felt discouragement from my mission experience. Two major surgeries, some permanent disability and some “Oh woe is me” left me with the thought, “What a waist of time!”\nAfter my mission, I went to BYU as a music education major with organ as my instrument. My first experience was memorable. Professor JJ Keeler asked about my background. From that time on he called me Mr. Hammond.\nI soon discovered that my training on the Hammond Organ was not at all acceptable to the world of classical organists. One must have special shoes. One must sit “just so” on the bench. Classical organists write fingering, pedaling, phrasing, registration and piston numbers on their music. Precision and exactness, I soon learned, are far more important than digital dexterity, showiness, and improvisational skills.\nIt was discouraging to say the least. I felt I had something to offer in the world of jazz and popular organ playing. But, I was at the bottom of the barrel when it came to the more churchly instrument. I felt something like the venerable May West, who is believed to have said, “I used to be Snow White, and then I drifted!”\nI left BYU for several years and developed a restaurant chain of three stores called Pipes and Pizza. It was a good business. One Sunday afternoon, I opened the Church News and saw a picture of Paul Rudolph. I could hardly believe my eyes. I opened to the article and read about his accomplishments. He was the son of the Tlinket Tribal Chief, who had died. As is the tribal custom, Paul had become the Tribal Chief. He had invited his people to learn about the church so that they would understand his religious beliefs. Several hundred people eventually joined and he had been called as the bishop. As a boy, he had learned to chant the genealogy of his people, since there was no written language. Through the efforts of wonderful people in Salt Lake, Paul was able to have his chant transcribed so that temple work could be completed for the people of his tribal ancestors.\n\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of a sudden, my missionary experience had become a success. I felt embarrassment for my rather immature attitude and asked the Lord’s forgiveness. I made a commitment right there and then that I would do everything I could to help prepare my children for missions. And, if one could serve the Spanish speaking people of the world, it might in some way vindicate what I had been unable to accomplish during my mission.\n“Just be good a boy and a good girl and someday you will look back and see that you were in the right place at the right time!”\n1976 we sold our interest in the Utah stores, and moved to California to operate that business.\nOne evening, a familiar voice was on the telephone. Newell Dayley said, “I will be in Los Angeles next week; can I come and visit with you?” He was kind. He asked about our family, our church service, our happiness. He asked if I had considered finishing my degree and opened my mind to other possibilities. My wife and I talked and prayed and fasted. I came back to BYU for one semester to complete my required California Teachers Certification. I returned home to teach music in the Ventura County School Systems.\nI loved teaching, but I was uncomfortable in the environment of fenced campuses, drug dealers, and budget cuts. After more prayer and soul searching, we sold our business and returned to BYU to graduate school.\nMany powerful experiences began unfolding in our lives. I was called to a bishopric and saw the Church from a very different perspective.\nI was privileged to serve as a guest organist at the Salt Lake Tabernacle. That was a treasured experience. The mixing of a unique building, the magnificent tonal pallet of the organ, and the feeling of reverence and awe that permeates ones soul; coupled together to create genuinely sacred moments.\nI was assigned to go to Jerusalem to inspect the Marcussen Pipe Organ installed in the BYU Center for Near Eastern Studies. While there, I was privileged to have some time alone sitting under a tree on the shores of the Sea of Galilee reading the New Testament. I read about the Savior’s walk on the water, and Peter’s dramatic attempt. I read about the Saviors call to the fisherman to “cast your nets on the other side.” I wondered if I might somehow be in the vicinity of these and other great miracles. Is it possible that the Savior might have been where I was then privileged to be?\nFrom over my shoulder came the sound of a voice. Abada, Abada, he called. I turned to see a Bedouin shepherd calling one of a small herd of sheep. Abada was easy to identify. Her tail perked up, her head raised from grazing, and she followed her master as he led her to the edge of the fresh water. There he knelt down beside her and washed her eyes and face and her rump. Then he carefully examined and cleaned each foot. After she had her fill of the fresh water, he wrapped his arms around her neck and petted her, and snuggled her, and spoke softly and lovingly to her. Then he stood, led her back to the fold, and called another. I watched with tenderness as he repeated the process over and over with each of the twelve or so sheep.\nI became witness to the Saviors instruction to “feed my sheep, feed my lambs”.\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoon after my return, I was called as bishop of my home ward. I quickly understood the lesson. Leave the ninety and nine, and go after the one.\nAt my release as my home ward bishop after 6 1⁄2 years, I was called as a bishop on campus to a freshman ward. We sent out approximately 50 missionaries a semester. After 3 1⁄2 years I was released from that wonderful service.\nWhile serving as bishop our first son was called to serve a mission. I was full of great anticipation as that process unfolded. When his call came to Santiago, Chile, I was beside myself in joy. Tears flowed easily as I understood how much the Lord loved me, and answered my plea. When our second son received his call to Anaheim, California, Spanish, my gratitude was so deep and my heart so full, I could hardly speak. Our third child, a daughter, was then called to Santiago West, Chile. There are no words to express my feelings. I just looked at her letter and wept. Our fourth, another daughter, had been engaged to be married twice. She finally said, “Dad, I think I need to serve a mission, but I don’t want to learn a language, but instead want to learn a culture. I suggested that she needed to talk with her Heavenly Father, that I had nothing to do with such matters. Her plea was heard and she was called to Atlanta, Georgia. She was blessed with learning a culture. Each missionary served with spiritual awareness and humility. I was awakening to the power of the Spirit and the knowledge that He knows us and loves us and wants to help us.\nQuit worrying, quit stewing, and just be worthy!\nAnother assignment came to serve in a BYU stake presidency with Newell Dayley. Our stake was comprised of single adults under 30. We sent many women on missions, and were privileged to witness hundreds of marriages in our years together.\nThe MTC was our next adventure. We were called to serve in a Spanish Branch. Imagine, some 40- plus years after being called to serve in Mexico, to now be able to serve with those wonderful Latino missionaries. I knew the Lord had a plan for me. I was asked to play for Devotionals and accompany the missionaries to sing. No one sings with the joy and exuberance of 2500 committed missionaries as they belt out Called to Serve.\nIn 2004 I was asked to go to Jerusalem again to work on the organ. I took my wife. On the way back we spent two weeks in London and 10 days in Sweden. For many years our family has been stopped in getting genealogy beyond my great-great grandfather. I felt prompted to take my genealogy and to see if someone could help.\nWe flew to Stockholm. From Stockholm we drove 7 1⁄2 hours north to Harnosand; and then we drove 20 miles inland to Sabra and found the City Library that was for some unknown reason open on a holiday afternoon. It just happened that a young man about 25, was at the library and could speak English fluently. He helped us locate the cemetery and my great-grandfather’s grave and the family farm on a City map. He asked why we had come all this way. I told him that I was interested in genealogy and was trying to track down some information about my ancestors. That I had come to a dead end and thought I might find some clue if I came to the land of my heritage. This young man said he was very interested in genealogy and wanted to see my genealogy sheets. After a brief study of a few ancestral lines, he said, “I think some of your lines coincide with some of mine. Let me go home and get my genealogy and I will meet you at your hotel.\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe provided us with links to new information and several hundred names for which we were able to complete the temple work. He also provided us with a book on the history of Sabra, Sweden, which included pictures, stories, accounts of importance, and yes, more genealogy. Consider the magnitude of that simple encounter just because of what I will describe as a step in the dark, a leap of faith, just pressing on!\nWe feel that our steps have been guided.\nWe have felt the prompting of the Holy Ghost.\nWe have tried to be a good boy and a good girl.\nWe have tried to honor our covenants.\nWe feel that the Lord has guided us in our journey through life.\nI have been blessed with significant opportunities as an organist.\nTeaching music theory at BYU has been a most rewarding and satisfying journey.\nServing in the councils of the Church has deepened my testimony. I know we are lead and guided by a prophet of God.\nFor 25 years I have served in the Executive Council of the School of Music. I have been personally involved in the recruiting, admission, scholarship awarding, teaching, and nurturing of hundreds if not thousands of wonderfully talented music students. What a significant blessing in my life.\nI have seen my four children serve honorable missions, marry in a temple, and I can now extend my arms to15 grandchildren.\nLike the saints of an earlier time, we have learned that:\nThe Lord is extending the Saint’s understanding, Restoring their judges and all as at first.\nThe knowledge and power of God are expanding; The veil o’er the earth is beginning to burst.\nWe’ll sing and we’ll shout with the armies of heaven, Hosanna, hosanna to God and the Lamb!\nLet glory to them in the highest be given, Hence forth and forever, Amen and amen!\nIn the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t2011\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\tConsider Music\nKeynote Address given on August 2, 2011\nMadsen Recital Hall, Harris Fine Arts Center BYU Organ Workshop\nJeremy B. King\nThe Neal A. Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship Brigham Young University\nGood morning and welcome to the campus of Brigham Young University, it’s a pleasure for me to meet with you for a few minutes this morning. As I stand here, I suppose that I am surrounded by a group of very talented musicians. I don’t think I exaggerate by saying that I am not musically gifted. I wonder what I can say or offer this group that might be worthwhile for you to hear. I hope I can share my appreciation for what you do to brighten the lives of those who hear the music you create. I’ve come to learn that understanding another human being, and seeing things from another’s perspective is a very difficult thing to do. Perhaps in the next few minutes I can give you a glimpse of what music means to me, and so many like me who, although we don’t create beautiful music, find deep spiritual meaning and significance in listening to the music created and played by others. I don’t think of myself as a victim, but there are at least two things that seem out to get me: (1) horses and (2) musical instruments. There’s no need to tell you about the half a dozen ill-fated horse experiences. But I will mention the handful of attempts I’ve made to learn a musical instrument, all of which have ended badly. Let me give a little background. Playing a musical instrument was always a goal of mine. As a middle-school -aged youth I thought the coolest instrument of all was the bagpipes. Perhaps all of you organ players are thinking I at least had the “pipes” part correct. I imagined myself playing the bagpipes at the front of parades, school assemblies, and maybe the occasional funeral in Scotland. But it wasn’t to be. For one thing, I grew up in a small town with a small school. We had a band, but we didn’t have an orchestra…no strings…we just had brass, woodwind and percussion…certainly no bagpipes. Even now, after moving away from a small town I don’t see bagpipes around. What section would a bagpipe be a part of anyway? Maybe we should add an “awesome” section? Since I couldn’t even find a store that sold bagpipes in Payette, Idaho, I decided to settle for the clarinet. I didn’t last long with the clarinet before I switched to the much flashier trombone. It was with my trusty trombone in hand that I received my first and only “F” in an academic subject. That F might as well have stood for “Final” because I gave up on playing an instrument for good. I don’t suppose many of you can empathize with me on this point…after all, who flunks out of band? Perhaps I lacked the patience, or just didn’t practice enough. In the end, though, I think it came down to talent and effort, and I felt both were lacking in my case. Although I’ve never mastered an instrument, or found myself to be a musician, let me share with you a quality concerning music that I do have. That is the quality of loving and appreciating beautiful music. I am currently serving as a Bishop for my church (Latter Day Saint). As a leader in my congregation I am often presiding in meetings I attend. During my time as Bishop I’ve actively encouraged music as a form of worship and renewal. Recently, it’s come to my attention that I have a reputation for being “pro-music”. I laughed a little bit when I was told that for the first time. Honestly it’s hard for me to imagine someone who is not pro-music…To me being against music would be like being against friendship or light…..although there is a lot of noise out in the world masquerading as music. I think what is meant in this case by being promusic is a proactive desire to include music and more music in our worship services.. Since the meetings are under my direction, I have the chance to influence a bit of what goes on out there. Thanks to some gifted musicians, who are willing to share their talents, we’ve had some really great music. We’ve enjoyed vocal solos, organ solos, duets, beautiful choir pieces, and lots and lots of congregational hymns accompanied by the organ. On, Easter Sunday this year we closed our meeting by singing two hymns in medley fashion. The organ sounded out with power and passion, and it seemed to me that the earth itself was joining in the song. We often begin and end our meetings with music because of the tone it sets. Just last month one member of my congregation was so touched by the prelude music she approached me and expressed her appreciation for the beautiful music, “I really needed that” she said. Almost without fail following a special musical number the speaker who follows will say something like, “we should just end the meeting now” or “ I wish they could just keep singing.” It is my firm belief that music touches us in ways that nothing else can. The same person who can sit through a sermon completely unmoved will be brought to tears by music. In my congregation we have many, many, little children and new born infants. When things line up just right, we really create quite a ruckus, you know, things get really loud. I am so grateful when the music portion of the program comes, not only does it drown out some of that noise, it actually calms down the children. I’ve witnessed this first hand with my little daughter. Children often stop playing or crying and look towards the source of the music. What a wonderful testimony that is about the power of music to touch our soul. Even from the earliest ages of our life our spirits understand music and feel its influence. We live in a world of clutter and noise. We live in a world of distraction. There is a counterfeit to virtually everything that is good and noble. Music is no exception. So much of what claims to be music is nothing more than noise, and in some cases is quite spiritually destructive. Sometimes we underestimate the effect of good music. Likewise, we may not recognize how harmful bad music can be. In this “the age of information” with virtually every book and song at our fingertips, we need ambassadors who promote and create and perform the very best of music. I believe this group qualifies as part of that group. I expect all of you promote music that edifies and enlarges the soul, music that brings a measure of peace, or strengthens us in our convictions. Consider the power of music. Is it any wonder that parents sing their children lullaby’s before they go to bed? After a bad dream parents may even sing themselves a lullaby. When an unclean thought enters our mind, we may use music to drive it away. In the dark corners of my life, I have found music to be a light that pierces through the darkness and reminds me of a better place. We are all wanderers in a strange land, far from home. And although we are far from our heavenly home, we are privileged to speak one of the languages of Heaven, that of sacred music. I need music. I need music to soothe my soul and calm my children. I need those who are willing to create good music, or who perform music created by others. Of all the arts, music is so re-creatable. The great works of the masters can be performed today just as they were hundreds of years ago. Those who perform these great pieces actually create them for me, and I feel as if I am hearing Bach or Mozart or sacred hymns for the first time. I wonder if there are any here who don’t feel appreciated. Perhaps you practice and prepare and then feel like no one is listening. Perhaps you feel like some aren’t paying attention, or worse yet, there may be some who speak and interrupt you. I know there are times when I’ve spoken in church when I wonder if anyone at all is paying attention. I believe that many are listening, and that even those who aren’t paying reverent attention benefit from the atmosphere you create. I mentioned earlier the example of prelude music. Even with beautiful prelude music there are some who continue to make noise or distraction. But it is much better than it otherwise would be. Have you ever been guilty of playing the wrong note? There may be the occasional person who scoffs because the wrong note was played, but there are always some who mock. I suppose there are times when efforts go unnoticed and unappreciated. There is great value in persevering even when it goes unnoticed. When I was in high school I was fascinated by dog sledding. I read books and watched documentaries about the sport. I planned to one day compete in the 1,000 mile Iditarod dog sled race in Alaska. Even though I didn’t have a dog, I decided to charter a club. After doing some paperwork, I was the inaugural member of the Payette High School Dog Sledding Club. Anyone could join, but people with dogs were preferred. People with larger dogs, especially Malamutes and Huskies were preferred even more. I made plans to construct my own dog sled and started training (and by training I mean I jogged and got in better physical shape). I coerced a couple of my friends into joining. As I recall, one of them owned a Chihuahua, and the other owned two black labs. The Chihuahua was so small that his whole body would fit through just one of the holes in a dog sled harness, so Bo (the Chihuahua was named Bo) was mostly a symbolic member of the team. The other two dogs, black labs (one of which was named Bear) were big enough, but my friends dad wouldn’t let us use them for practice. No one with suitable dogs ever joined that dog sledding club. Since we didn’t have any dogs the sled never got built. I laugh at it now; my poor little club, my dog-sledding club, had neither dogs nor sleds. Wouldn’t that be like an organ solo without an organ? To my knowledge no one has ever attempted to re-charter the club after that first year. By almost every measure available to humankind that dog sledding club was a failure. Since we had no funding, we didn’t even have a “going out of business “ party. I mention this story for a reason. (I figured you’d be getting bored of me by this point in my talk and I needed a good funny story to wake you up). But let me draw a point from this…… I doubt the dog-sledding club ever did anything for my friends, but it was good for me. In my attempt to create something good, I became a better person. I learned and studied and genuinely enjoyed the experience (with the exception of not finding any suitable dogs). You’d have to be a pretty poor musician to fail as miserably in your musical pursuits as I did in my dog-sledding pursuits, but you’d still be a better person for having made the effort? Some efforts don’t yield the results we expect, but there is great value in persevering even when it goes unnoticed. By the way, I am no longer assembling a dog sled team, so please don’t offer me your stray dogs to me after the meeting. A powerful story is told of music finding a foothold in the hearts of men even during a time of war. During the winter of 1914, about 100,000 World War I troops were involved in an unofficial ceasefire. It began, by German soldiers putting up some candles and Christmas decorations around their trenches. The soldiers continued the celebration by singing Christmas carols. The British responded by singing carols of their own. The two sides continued by shouting Christmas greetings to one another and more singing. Soon thereafter there were excursions across no-man’s land, where small gifts were exchanged. The truce also allowed for a period of peace so recently fallen soldiers could be brought back behind their lines for burial. In many sectors the truce lasted through Christmas night and in some places until New Years Day. What an unlikely “Silent Night” that must have been. I realize we are in the very heat of summer now, but when I think about what music mean’s to me I can’t help but make another reference to Christmas music. I love Christmas music. I find it to be joyful and uplifting. One of my best memories as a youth is that of riding on a trailer full of hay along the dark and empty streets in my hometown and singing Christmas Carols. People would come out of their homes as we passed by and listen to the songs. One of those carols, and one of my favorites is “I heard the Bell’s on Christmas Day”. It says in part, “In despair, I bowed my head, there is no peace on earth I said, for Hate is strong and mocks the song of peace on earth goodwill to men……then peeled the bells more loud and deep, “God is not dead nor doth he sleep, the wrong shall fail, the right prevail with peace on earth goodwill to men.” May we be like those bells, ringing out, for all to hear who will hear. Never in the history of the world has music been more important because of its unique ability to reach the hearts of us all and touch us for good. I am anxiously looking forward to the upcoming Christmas season. As a congregation we are planning to go Christmas caroling. We will sing together out in the streets of Provo. We’ll stop by the homes of the elderly, the sick, or the downtrodden. I know the power beautiful music has to “lift the hands that hang down”. And there are so many hands that hang down. We are a better people and a better world because of music and those who share their musical talents with us. I know I am in a group of musically talented people today. Many of you have served for years in different capacities relating to music, and the organ. Please keep preparing ,and serving and sharing your gift with me and others like me. We need you. I know that many of you are involved in the music for religious congregations. I’d like to suggest how music may become a more important and appreciated part of your meetings: Break out of the routine. Sometimes when we do the same things again and again, in the same order, we get into a routine. Routines can be good, there is great power of consistency that comes from establishing a pattern, but routine often leads to complacency and lead us to take something for granted. Some of the things we’ve done in my congregation to break out of our routine include mixing up the order and frequency of musical selections. We may have one intermediate hymn or a choir selection, or one of each. When we sing a song we sing all verses, not just the main verses printed next to the music but the additional verses listed at the end, we don’t cut our songs short for expediency. Even when we are running late, we sing the entire hymn. We have a variety of music and use a good mix of old favorites and new pieces. We ask many to participate. Our youth and children sing. Some of our meetings consist almost exclusively of music such as our Easter Sunday or Christmas program. Perhaps one of the best things we’ve done to break the routine was to have two closing hymns on Easter Sunday. Doesn’t that say, “We aren’t just singing to close the meeting because that is what we do…we are singing because music belongs here….it’s Easter…let’s worship the Lord in song.” We’ve talked today about the great power music has to edify and enlarge our souls. We recognize that so much music, especially sacred music, has great power to strengthen us spiritually and fortify our convictions. As a non-musician who admittedly doesn’t understand how much effort it must take, “thank you for your efforts”. I’m grateful to you for developing your talents and for your willingness to share your talent. I hope you have a wonderful conference. I’m sure you’ll be edified and enlarged by the things you hear and learn over the next several days. May you take that edification and share it in whatever capacity you can. Let us find hope through music. Like us be like those wonderful Christmas bells that go “Ringing, Singing, on their way….A voice, a chime, a chant sublime of Peace on Earth, good will to men.”\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t2012\n\t\tEmpty tab. Edit page to add content here.\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t2013\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\tRobert Cundick\n2013\n I am honored to address you today as the keynote speaker at this annual BYU Organ Workshop. This event continues to be a superb source of information and inspiration for all participants. \n I was very surprised when Don Cook invited me to speak as I do not accept speaking or performance requests because of my physical condition. The spirit falters and the flesh continues to weaken. The only exception is an occasional special funeral, such as my close friend Beverley Sorenson’s. I had previously played for her husband Jim’s services. The very large congregation was filled with luminaries from throughout the state. I selected the simplest organ music possible and played it very slowly. I felt that I myself was not far from being in a coffin and I’m sure that the listeners agreed. \n I’m now almost 87 years of age. I am the oldest living Temple Square organist as well as the oldest living Tabernacle choir organist. Thus, I have lived and experienced a long period of continuing evolution in the music of the Restored Church as it strives to meet the complex needs of a now world-wide presence. Let me share some of my singular musical experiences both past and present. \n I started “in the trenches” so to speak when a new Hammond model A electronic organ arrived at our Sandy 2nd ward. It replaced our old hand-pumped reed organ. “This is the instrument of the future”, the salesman confidently proclaimed. “Pipe organs will be obsolete in ten years”. I was fascinated by the sound which could be synthesized in seemingly endless variety by means of the drawbars. I promptly enrolled in a General Music Committee sponsored 12 week course for beginning organists. Upon the completion, I was called to be a Sunday School organist. I was twelve years old at the time. In those days, organ and even vocal music was performed during the passing of the sacrament. Among other ear-pleasing pieces, I often naively played “Hymn of the Nuns”. (This was during World War ll.) I remember attending a neighboring ward and hearing “Comin’ in on a wing and a prayer. (Tho’ there’s one engine gone, we will still carry on, comin’ in on a wing and a prayer”). Shortly thereafter, the Church abolished all sacramental music. While I was initially shocked, I soon realized that this was an inspired change. Thereafter I have continued to treasure this time in our services when we can contemplate the true meaning of the sacrament in complete (or almost complete) quiet. How I wish that this was the case during the organ prelude as well. \n We sang the songs in Deseret Sunday School Songs published by The Deseret Sunday School Union. “Count Your Many blessings”, “Did You Think to Pray” and “Dear to the Heart of the Shepherd” were among the favorites. These songs were beloved by the General Authorities. Though they were omitted in later publications, they reappeared in our latest hymnal due to the desire of these elderly brethren. They are now often curiously referred to as “Hymns of the Restoration”. \n To be prepared for every Sunday School song practice, I spent an entire summer learning to play all of these songs. I would start with the first page and proceed to play each song at a moderate tempo without stopping. I would continue to play each successive song in the same manner until 1 finished the last page of the book. It was a grueling task but at the end of the summer I could confidently play any of these songs at the correct tempo without mistakes. As a result I found that I could sight-read most music. This skill has proved to be invaluable throughout my entire career. \n After several years of private lessons, my teacher felt that I should study with Alexander Schreiner. Neither my parents or I could afford his very high lesson fees during these Great Depression times. Fortunately, Schreiner accepted me as his only scholarship student. \n At the same time I met my wonderful high school music teacher, Donald Olsen. A BYU graduate, he was a fine violinist and a former student of Leroy J. Robertson. He showed me a manuscript copy of The Lord’s Prayer. The heavens opened. I was overwhelmed by its glorious sound. This encounter later proved to be a turning point in my life when 1 entered the U. of U.\n After high school in 1945, I served in the Merchant Marine for two years. Following my release, I enrolled at the U. of U. as a freshman music major. Since my service was not included in the GI Bill of Rights, I didn’t receive any financial assistance. I continued to be self-supporting, as 1 had been since high school days. In addition to teaching piano and organ lessons, I played piano in jazz bands. \n One of my organ students was Charlotte Ann Clark. She lived just a block away. She was 16 years old. I was 4 years older, but we had much in common. We belonged to the same ward (Sandy 2nd) and had attended the same high school (Jordan High). Moreover, we were both friends and faithful and fully committed Mormons. Mutual admiration slowly became deepest love and she accepted my engagement ring. When she excitedly showed it to her parents, her father asked, ”How will he support you?”. She confidently replied, “He’s a musician!”. Her father retorted, “I repeat the question, how will he support you?” \n We were married in the Manti Temple. We bought a small home at 424 Douglas Street, very close to the U. campus. I continued my studies while teaching dozens of beginning GI piano students in the U. of U. music department serving as organist at other churches such as 1st Unitarian and United Methodist on Sundays, plus Temple B’nai Israel on Friday nights and Christian Scientist mid-week, to earn a few extra dollars. I was Maurice Abravanel’s rehearsal pianist. This was all in addition to being a full-time student and loving husband and father. I did, indeed, support my wife and children very well, much to my father-in-law’s amazement. In retrospect I can appreciate his concern for his wonderful daughter. She truly is one-of-a-kind. Without her, I never could have succeeded. My greatest blessing is our eternal marriage. We now have 5 children, 23 grandchildren and 33 great-grandchildren. \n As a student at the U. of U. I finally met Leroy Robertson. In his graduate Bach to Contemporary class, he taught me to compose music for the first time in my life. Robertson was a superb teacher. This wonderful internationally famous composer was amazed at the maturity of Three Preludes and Fugues Tor Piano, which was my first work. Under Robertson’s constant inspiration and encouragement, I never looked back. I have continued to compose ever since. I have also stayed in close contact with the family since his death. I continue to make every effort to perpetuate his name and his priceless legacy. \n After graduation, we moved to Provo where I taught music theory at BYU. Five years later President David O. McKay called me and my family to England where I was to serve my first mission as organist at the new Hyde Park Chapel in London. One hectic week after our call we arrived to replace Roy Darley, who immediately left to return to Temple Square to resume his work as Assistant Tabernacle Organist. \n But where to begin? I hadn’t played the organ since we left Salt Lake, except to serve as organist in the Oak Hills 2nd Ward. All I had was a briefcase full of music. I was to play my first recital two days later and continue to play daily recitals 6 days each week. Other professional organists would ask, ”How can you possibly play six different recitals each week without breaking down?” To my consternation, our English ward and branch members would ask, ”ls that all you do? \n I began by contacting Robert Munns, who was organist at nearby Holy Trinity Church. He came to my rescue. He taught me appropriate new repertoire and explained British organ design and registration. With almost constant practice and a wonderful patient wife and family, I managed to cope with this formidable challenge. Alexander Schreiner had dedicated the organ and played the initial recitals. He had set a high standard. I felt that I would be on constant trial before a potential audience of world-famed musicians. I was only able to succeed with the constant help of the Lord. Equal amounts of prayer and careful practice was the final answer.\n Among many wonderful experiences, I will mention just two:\n The first was playing a recital at King’s College, Cambridge. My wife thought of King Henry VIII while I practiced in this silent dark, historic chapel. I was awed by the sound of this superb instrument. We were there as Francis Jackson’s guests. It was a singular feeling. \n The second was playing the organ accompaniment for Zoltan Kodaly’s Missa Brevis at St. Paul’s Cathedral in London. Robert Munns conducted his Holy Trinity Choir. Ralph Downes was scheduled as organist but was suddenly needed elsewhere. Robert asked me to deputize, or as we would say, “substitute” for Downes. The reverberation time was enormous. The console is located high above on the central screen. It is reached by a winding staircase. When I was rehearsing before hand, I played and abruptly released a single chord, quickly slid off the bench and raced down the stairs to stand in the center of the nave below. The chord was still sounding! “Use the dome trumpet as sparingly as possible”, I had been warned. “We’re afraid that it could crack the dome”. I had to use it for the final chord of the Kodaly. I could just imagine the possible world headlines: “Mormon organist destroys the dome at St. Paul’s Cathedral”. \n After our English mission, we returned to Provo where I resumed teaching at BYU. A year later, another call dramatically changed our lives. I was teaching a counterpoint class. A secretary threw the door open and excitedly shout, ”You must call the office of the First Presidency!” I ran to the phone and returned the call. I was told to come to Pres. Hugh B. Brown’s office immediately. When I arrived he told me that Frank Asper would retire. I was to be his replacement but I could only tell my wife until I was sustained at General Conference. Speculation on campus was rampant. I only could say that I wouldn’t be excommunicated or called on a another mission. I could say nothing more, I was certain of just one thing l would retire at age 65. \n As my close friend, the late Edward L. Hart wrote: “The past returns, the springs of time unwind, and all is present in the heart and mind”. So it is at this moment. I have shared my memory and feelings of these past events. In my mind’s eye, they are as vivid and real as if they had just occurred. \n The Tabernacle organ bench is a never-ending hot seat. The pressure of the work is unrelenting. In addition to live broadcasts, organ recitals, intensive organ practice and trying to be a good husband and father, I was executive head of the Church Music Dept. under Alexander Schreiner as chairman. As such, I designed and printed the Guidebook for Organists and assigned Ralph Woodward to write a Guidebook for Conductors and others to write similar guidebooks. \n I also managed to persuade the Primary and Sunday School organizations to agree upon the contents of a new children’s songbook. It was titled Sing With Me. I composed two new songs and invited such composers as Reid Nibley, Gaylen Hatton, Newell K. Brown, Jay Welch Merrill Bradshaw, Crawford Gates and others to contribute. I included songs from previous songbooks by both organizations. Finally. I carefully copied the entire contents in pencil manuscript for the printer. \n When Alexander Schreiner retired I was now the head organist. I chose John Longhurst as Schreiner’s replacement. John became my closest friend and confidant. \n I was privileged to work with some great men at the Tabernacle: Alexander Schreiner, Richard P. Condie, Jay Welch and Jerold Ottley. My happiest time was with Jerry. When Jerry became the conductor, we were able Io work together as a team conductors, organists and business manager. Although we have all retired, we still meet with these friends and their wives once a month. We are a closely-knit group. We call ourselves “The Emeritabs”. \n I had many friends and no known enemies among the General Authorities. Many called me “Bob”, rather than”Robert” or “Brother Cundick”. During our mission in England, Mark E. Petersen and N. Eldon Tanner became our close friends. Upon our return, both these and other General Authority doors were always open to me. Thus, the various worthy projects that John and I undertook had every chance for success. \n Among these are the procurement of the Robert Sipe tracker action organ, basement practice organs, harpsichords and Steinway pianos in the Assembly Hall. The only problem was that 1 personally had to raise the purchase money, which I did. John and I were so involved in the design of the remodeled building We also were responsible for procuring the necessary First Presidency approval for the rebuilding of the Tabernacle Organ by the Schoenstein Company, and the Casavant Organ in the Joseph Smith building. \n We initiated the guest organist program and received permission for the appointment of Bonnie Goodliffe and Linda Margetts as Temple Square Organists. They became the first women to hold such a position since Katherine Romney Stewart in 1900. We felt that such a change was long overdue. \n In the year 1991 as I had previously vowed, I retired as I was now 65 years of age. Pres. Howard W, Hunter had earlier asked us to serve as hosts at the BYU Jerusalem Center. Nov. 30th was my last day at the Tabernacle. On Pearl Harbor Day, Dec. 7th, just one week later we landed at Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv. From there we were driven up to the beautiful BYU Jerusalem Center on Mt. Scopus. \n Our assignment was to change the public perception of the Center from mistrust to complete trust and appreciation. This we accomplished by improving the hosting procedure and starting a new concert series. The Iron Curtain had now fallen, the USSR had now allowed Russian Jews to leave. Superb new Jewish musicians from Russia were arriving by the plane load almost daily. It seemed that everyone getting off the planes carried an instrument case. The saying was: “If they don’t carry a musical instrument case, it’s because they are a pianist”. As the musical job market was saturated, they were forced to accept menial work in order to survive. We featured them on the series, much to the native Israeli’s appreciation. Soon, every fine Jewish musician wanted to appear in concert at the center. We gained the sponsorship of the national music network, Kol Israel, the Jerusalem Rubin Academy of Music and the Jerusalem Symphony. These concerts have continued to be held to this day, even when BYU did not have students at the center. Visitor attendance grew from 9,000 per year to 70,000 when we left. \n I was also the catalyst to bring the Tabernacle choir to Israel. Their splendid concerts did much to bolster the Church’s image in Israel. \n We knew that we had accomplished our assignment when, just before we left, we were standing in a line at the Israel Museum. We heard a fine jewelry-loaded Jewish woman ask her obviously equally wealthy Jewish companion, “My dear, have you a«ended the marvelous concerts at our Jerusalem Center? If not, you must!” Her choice of the pronoun “our” was most gratifying. We wanted to cheer aloud! \n Richard Condie used to say, ”Good Mormons have ants in their pants”, meaning that they are “anxiously engaged in a good cause”. Your attendance here today is indeed proof of your commitment to organ excellence. \n I thank you very much for your kind attention.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t2014\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\nEverything I REALLY Know about Music, I Learned at Church\nJerry L. Jaccard, EdD\nBYU School of Music\n2014\nIntroduction\nThank, you Brother Cook, for this special opportunity to share some thoughts with fellow musicians of the Church. When Brother Cook invited me to give this keynote, he mentioned the possibility of also sharing some of my experiences with our late brother, Doug Bush. Therefore, I would like to dedicate this talk to the memory of Douglas Earl Bush. Doug was one of my very best friends; we drove all over Europe together sharing favorite places with each other while also working on our research projects. We teased each other that between us, we were all too well acquainted with every pastry and chocolate shop between Amsterdam and Budapest. Doug served a mission in German- speaking Switzerland, and I am of French-speaking Swiss ancestry, so we were both hopelessly in love with all things Swiss. However, he was not acquainted with Swiss chocolate from the French cantons, so that gave me an opportunity to expand his already considerable palette of options. From then on, he always brought back to me from his trips a few delectables made by the company where one of my Jaccard cousins had worked before retiring.\nDoug had never been to Hungary where I have been researching their wonderful and highly developed national music education system since 1980. So, my wife Alta and I arranged to meet him one day about 10 years ago at the main train station in Budapest, where he would be arriving from Vienna. We had already warned him about the over- eager (and sometimes aggressive) taxi drivers in case we were late. In what was surely the Lord’s perfect timing, Doug stepped out of the station just as we made our first circuit around the parking lot. I threw his suitcases into the trunk, he climbed into the back seat and we were off on our wild adventure. I noticed that he was carefully holding a cake- sized pastry box by the top strings and instinctively knew that chocolate would soon be involved. Our first stop was the Bulgarian Culture House where we would spend the first night. As soon as we installed Doug in his room, he invited us to sit on the edge of his bed and opened up the box to reveal a Sacher Torte fresh from Vienna. He divvied it up, and we polished it off like the three little pigs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next day, as we drove deep into the interior of Hungary, Doug would tell us to stop at what seemed like every other gas station to treat us to a Magnum ice cream bar. We must have eaten at least four apiece that afternoon. Alta and I later reflected that it was his way of thanking us for taking him around Hungary to scout out the possibility of his doing a future organ performance tour there. Alta and Doug both grew up on ranches, she in Arizona and he in Montana, so they understood each other perfectly and I was always the fall guy for their hilarious ranch stories. All it took was the sighting of a single cow to set them off again. We basically ate, laughed and giggled our way through the Hungarian countryside.\nHowever, as many of you know, there was much more to Doug than food, chocolate and his devastating wit (we couldn’t sit anywhere near each other in BYU faculty meetings). He also loved people, especially his students. We shared many students and what struck me the most was his acceptance of students with a wide range of abilities; he was as concerned with raising amateurs as well as professionals. I believe Doug never forgot his own humble journey from a less than musical rural atmosphere to the great musician, composer and teacher he became. The rest of my remarks today are intended to convey that attitude and spirit. It is perhaps the best way I can honor him and pass the baton to you and all those you will edify and teach in your homes, wards and stakes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalent Myth\nFrom my vantage point as a teacher of music teachers, I find that “talent” is one of the most misused words in our vocabularly. It seems that almost every person in our national society equates the Savior’s use of “talents” with the ability to perform something. However, in His context, it is clear that He is talking about opportunities for growth. The unprofitable servant was chastized not because he wasn’t capable, but because he did not seize the opportunity to become more capable. Understanding the matter of talent this way profoundly changes how we should think about whether or not people are “musical.” For my part, I boldly tell you that all of us are born musical; hundreds of my colleagues around the world agree with me. So, it becomes a matter of education, serious lifelong education, not haphazard or unsubstantial “tone baths” as one of my early mentors called it.1\nI home teach two wonderful sisters who have a sign prominently displayed for all visitors to see upon entering their humble home. It reads: “Comparison is the thief of joy.” Nothing could apply more perfectly to the world of musicians! The first great truth of music making is that there will always be someone who sings or plays better than you. Admit it, get over it, celebrate their accomplishments and enjoy yours. They are not truly artists if they give the slightest hint of disdain toward you, and you are not a true artist if you think you are superior to those of lesser musical prowess. The Zion standard for musicians must surely be one of mutual encouragement and cooperation as we build each other. The scriptural record teaches us that Zion will be a cooperative rather than a competitive endeavor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other great truth of music is that no matter how good we may be now or in the future, we all pale in comparison to the immense mountain we musicians choose to climb, that vast ever-growing body of literature called Music. I have always loved how Belgian-Swiss music psychologist Edgar Willems characterized our dilemma:\nBad musicians cannot hear what they are playing; Mediocre ones could hear it, but they don’t listen; Average musicians hear what they just played;\nOnly good musicians hear what they are going to play.2\nIn brief, music requires lifelong learning, whether at the professional, amateur or church calling level. It requires developing a careful balance among heart, head, ears and hands, in that order. We too often begin at the wrong end of that journey.\nWe are not great musicians just because we say we are, what I call “The Aïda Complex.” We lived back East for several years and at one point in time, a sister moved into our ward and announced that she was an opera singer. She was what Doug Bush would have called “one spicy meatball.” I happened to know from being on the Stake High Council and having heard her sing in another ward, that she thought she was an opera singer. She had the presence, she had the sound, but she did not have the ear. Unfortunately and inexplicably, bishop after bishop called her to be the ward music chairperson, which literally kept her from growing in the ways that other non-musical callings would provide for her. From that position of authority, she made sure that she sang in church once a month. Moreover, she sang opera arias slightly out of tune and loud enough to peel the paint off the walls. After a few months of this, a young child gave voice to what everyone was thinking in a scene that I shall never forget. The sister made her usual grand entrance from the back row up to the stand, tossing her thick mane of beautiful hair. Just as she started up the aisle, four-year-old Todd caught sight of her, stood up on the pew and loudly cried “Oh, no!” All of the adults immediately stuffed their fists in their mouths and their head between their legs. The whole congregation was a sea of heaving backs trying with all their might to maintain some sense of decorum. She was stunningly oblivious to the scene before her. Would you believe that it all happened again a month later, except that Todd’s mother reached up and grabbed him just as he said “Oh, no!” and when she pulled him down he whacked his forehead on the back of the pew, sounding like a rifle shot? He began to wail, and the tragic comedy of it all once again put the congregation nearly convulsing under their pews. She blithely sang through it all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI came to understand that this dear misguided and unfortunately enabled sister was suffering from a sort of musical sickness in which her self worth was bound to her own misconception of music. That realization was only the beginning of my own sorrows because I was soon called to be the ward choir director. She came habitually late to rehearsals and insisted on singing with her opera voice. I finally had to do something about it to avoid driving away the rest of the choir members. So after much thought, prayer, and practicing the right tone of voice, I finally mustered up the courage to say, “Sister, would you please be so kind as to use your choir voice.” Her response was, “Oh no, I can’t do that because my voice has been trained.” And so while you are here this week to seek “training” in organ playing, please remember that music is something we do with people, not to them. It should not be an affliction we visit upon those within our spheres of influence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, please be aware that as organists, you play the biggest, potentially loudest instrument on earth. Please do all you can to make sure that the little Todds of the Church will not cry out in anguish, “Oh, no!” when you begin to play. Church service playing, including preludes and postludes, are not recitals. One of my favorite local high school choral directors once told me of being on tour with their university choir in a resort town in another country. While they were walking down the main street together looking in the shop windows late at night one of their singers who was notorious for being the resident diva (another “spicy meatball”) shouted, “Look, it says GO Diva!” They were stunned to see that she was pointing to a display of Godiva chocolates, then stunned again when they realized she really didn’t know! The Church does not need divas or divos of any sort, but humble musicians who know the true place of music in the sacrament service.\nElder Kevin S. Hamilton of the Seventy indirectly spoke about the true function of music in the sacrament meeting in his October 2013 conference talk: “Each week we have the opportunity to attend a sacrament meeting, where we can renew these covenants by partaking of the bread and water of the sacrament ordinance . . . God’s promise to us in return is His Spirit as a guide and protection.” Continuing on he says, “We renew our covenants, receive an increased measure of the Spirit, and have the additional blessing of being instructed and edified by the Holy Ghost.”3 In other words, all of our playing of prelude music and the accompanying and singing of hymns must help the congregation approach the ordinance of the sacrament in the utmost reverence while also inviting the Spirit to attend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNothing could be clearer. Please work with your choristers to agree on tempi, staying within the range of beats per minute as indicated in the Hymnal. Please chose prelude and postlude pieces that invite and retain the Spirit rather than displaying your technically virtuosity. To play lyrically, softly and in a subdued, quiet way requires a different kind of virtuosity rooted in your own spirituality. Mastering the art of registration on the particular organ in your chapel goes a long way toward providing spiritually conducive music. If you respect the music, then others will also and many of the musical problems we experience in wards will disappear. Take the music seriously, yourselves not so much!\nAs if the “Aïda Complex” episodes in our ward out East were not enough, the new bishop was also an organist. Up until his arrival, we had enjoyed the soft, reverent music of our three very fine ward organists, any two of whom occasionally played wonderful organ-piano duet hymn arrangements for special musical numbers. But this highly competitive bishop wanted everyone to know that he was a “classically trained” organist and to my horror, dismissed the three from playing the postludes so that he could play them, which he choose to be the great Bach preludes and fugues at full blast. The congregation fled from the chapel and so began the habit of “fellowshipping in the halls” instead of going straight to Sunday School classes. I tried to talk to him about it, but he disdained what he perceived to be the inferior talents of the other three, harking back to what I said at the beginning of this talk. As one who believes in the innate musicality of all mankind, I was greatly saddened by his attitude.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow Here Comes Something More Than Music\nMusic is a powerful force pervading the Universe. In the 1970’s, the NASA Voyager missions transmitted back to Earth musical sounds seemingly organized like compositions as emitted by the magnetospheres of the planets of our solar system, their moons and their interactions with the solar wind. But music also fills our inner universe, that of our souls. One of my dearest colleagues is a masterful musician, Gabriella Thész, the former director of the world reknown Hungarian Radio Children’s Choir who now directs the Children’s Choir of the Hungarian National Philharmonic. She once told me in a recorded interview:\nPart rehearsals are very intimate. I can sit down and talk to them and I can tell them so many times just little things in comparison to the music. Not only pure intonation, because if their soul is okay, they will be singing much differently. Now, this Bartók piece for example, Párnás Tancdal, is philosophical and here comes something more than music, because this is about life. The main idea is to form their personality through their soul [and] their sensitivity, and that means they become different people through music. So the music helps me talk to them. The music is the instrument I’m using to change them [and] to give ideas [to them] from people like composers. Music doesn’t give you words—music gives you more, it changes the soul. I teach them how to speak the language of music, and actually, we form their spirit, their soul, their mind, their whole personality. It’s part of the work, which belongs to the art [of music]. So art forms people and we would not be able to live without art.4 (edited for clarity and continuity, emphases added)\nFind the Balance\nAs organists, you may be wondering why I keep talking about singers, singing and choirs. Well, it’s because singing is how the vast majority of Church members make music during Church services. Your calling is to accompany them, but as you already know, you often find yourselves in the position of enlightening and teaching them, an aspect of your calling which will require much tender Christlike nurturing, patience and diplomacy. Albert Lavignac, one of the great musical minds of the Paris Conservatory and Debussy’s teacher once wrote: “He/she who is only a pianist is not a good pianist.” In other words, you must have a multi-dimensional life, because your music can only reflect the richness of your life or the lack thereof. All good organists know that they should also\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbe able to conduct, to rehearse, and to sing. These are the tools they have through which to help others give public utterance to the Spirit during times of worship.\nI also encourage you to have frequent, long and deep talks with yourself about your own life, the musical part of it and all of its other dimensions. President David O. McKay often taught the importance of personal and prayerful meditation. Use these times to check up on whether you are balanced. Are you so consumed by your passion for music that you are telling the Lord and His local Church leaders what callings you should have? Do you have the faith and courage to open yourself up to other callings through which, as in the Parable of Talents, you can seize opportunities to grow in other directions and dimensions? If you can, I promise you that you will become a better musician because you will ultimately have more to express through your musicianship. A great deepening and maturing will take place in your musical expressions because the prime function of music is to express the life in Life.\nI once saw a wonderful sign on the door of a restaurant in Paris: “Fresh vegetables served according to the rhythm of the seasons.” Meditate on the times and seasons of your life in which music may sometimes be at the forefront and at other times in the background. Live, love, have a life, be well rounded, be an interested and interesting person. This life is the one chance you have to fully experience the delights of mortality in this beautiful creation the Lord has made expressly for us. As Isaiah wrote, “Jehovah is my strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.”5 Let Him be yours as well, for His purpose is that you “might have joy.”6 Alma asks us if we “have felt to sing the song of redeeming love.”7 May all of our music making and teaching convey that pure love melody, first to Deity and then to those we serve. Bach knew this, whose Solo Dei Gloria not only adorned his compositions, but also Doug’s home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nIf I were to ask you to remember only one thing from this talk, it would be that “Comparison is the thief of joy.” Rejoice in who you are and in who you are becoming. Celebrate the fact that God made you, that there is just one of you that has ever been created, that you are unique and wonderful! Greet yourself in the mirror every morning in this way, even make a sign to stick on the mirror if it will help you to remember: “I am loveable, capable and competent, and when today is over, I will have made this world better!” Filling it with music is a great place to start.\nThank you and God bless you!\n\n\n\n\n1 The late O.M.

You might think there is a line on the calendar of my life separating when formal lessons ended and life as an organist began but that is not the case.\nSince I only have five minutes, I will spare you the details of why I chose the organ, and of my first several years of study. I do want to share some stories and facts that I hope inspire you on your journey.\nI will start with an experience that took place two floors beneath us, in E-208, the office of JJ Keeler, then chair of the BYU organ department. In those days, you did not come to BYU to audition seven months in advance of your first day as a freshman. You auditioned after you arrived. I found Brother Keeler stern and very intimidating. Instead of asking me to play, he proceeded to interview me. One question in particular I will never forget. “How many years of piano have you had?” “None” I answered innocently, “but I’ve had…” He cut me off. “You need to go home and take at least five years of piano. Then come back and we’ll talk.” I can’t go home, I thought. My parents dropped me off and left. I’ve moved into the dorms. I’m here to be an organ major. I don’t have a Plan B! Despite a quivering lower lip, I asked “May I at least play for you?” “(grumble grumble) Ok.” Short version: He let me in. But I had to make up for my lack of piano background through all four years of undergraduate study and during the summers. And I am grateful for that.\nSometimes we don’t know we have weaknesses until others, often teachers, point them out to us. This is one of the many reasons I keep going back to take lessons or get coaching from organists that know a great deal more than I do. Often I might think I am putting the finishing touches on a piece, only to check it with the metronome, or after listening to a recording of myself. Ah, but there’s so much left to do and to fix! Sometimes metronomes, recorders and even the ears of others can be our teachers.\nFollowing college, much of my continuing education has come from attending workshops, concerts and conventions put on by the American Guild of Organists. I am a better teacher after taking notes at master classes by Russell Saunders, David Higgs, Olivier Latry and others. I know more about organs and the artists that play them because of the monthly The American Organist periodical. I am more motivated to practice and more creative in my registrations after attending wonderful concerts. I also have a growing list of organ literature I want to learn. This is not the last you will hear of the AGO this week, I guarantee it. That’s because this organization exists, much like this Workshop, to help you succeed. I recently returned from the regional AGO convention in San Diego, where the motivation I received will likely last well beyond the end of the year. Join the AGO! You’ll be glad you did.\nAnd now a little science. Did you know that your brain has a quality called plasticity? This means you can teach your brain, however old or young, new tricks. And in fact, your brain appreciates being taught NEW tricks. It might be fun to keep on doing what you already do well: Golf, juggling, piano. But the brain is kept young and supple by learning new coordination skills. Did you hear that? Can you think of anything\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthat will dust the cobwebs out of your brain more thoroughly than playing the organ? And hey, it’s safer than taking up gymnastics. As far as I’m concerned, every Bach trio sonata is like learning a new sport. While working out a tricky section, you can now imagine the neurons in your brain branching out to new areas formerly unused.\nI once came to this Workshop and heard a teacher say, “As organists we do hard things.” I went home that summer and promptly told my family that we had a new family motto: We Do Hard Things. More recently I heard someone add to this bit of inspiration by quoting the verse in Philippians, “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.” (Philippians 4:13) So often in organ study or in life, we think, this is just too hard. I’m not up for this. And that’s probably true, if it were all up to just us and our skill sets. But it’s not. I have a former adult student who began every practice session with prayer. She often felt guided in her preparations for playing in church on Sunday. A current student shared with me recently that in the solitude of the chapel when she is practicing she has distinctly felt the approval of the Lord for the work she is engaged in.\nI am so grateful to be here — this is my favorite week of the year. I predict that you will simultaneously be stretched and challenged AND have a great time. And at the end of the week, I hope you’ll join me and many others in being a perennial student.\n__________\nDaniel Kerr\nI am glad to add my welcome to all of you here at the BYU Organ Workshop. Each of you is here to learn something about the organ. Perhaps you are just starting out; others of you may be capable players who are here for a boost and to polish up some specific aspect of the craft. Regardless of where you are in your abilities, the fact that you are here speaks to your desire to improve. So, during this week, dig into the material and do your best to master it!\nI have found an analogy that is helpful in demonstrating the value and importance of thorough, dedicated, diligent practice, and it has to do with construction. Now, I am hardly an expert on construction management, but in the eleven years that I have lived in Rexburg, Idaho, I have seen many buildings built from the ground up, and have found some (hopefully) helpful parallels between building a building and developing as a musician.\nEvery time a new building is announced, there is a festive groundbreaking, where speeches are given, prayers are offered, and an artist’s rendering of the completed structure is displayed. There is a great sense of excitement and anticipation for the building that is to come.\nBut then an interesting thing happens: seemingly nothing! At least, it appears that nothing happens. But work is going on. Rocks and debris are cleared; the land is smoothed and graded. Trenches are dug deeply. Rock is sometimes blasted out, and then wooden planks are lowered into the trenches. It is hot, dusty, dirty, messy work. It is unglamorous, and bears little resemblance to what the final product will look like.\nAfter the wooden forms are in place, then concrete is poured into the forms and the foundation is laid. Once the concrete has cured, the forms are removed and then repositioned to form the foundation walls. Concrete is again poured and cured to form the foundation walls. This takes a long time, and happens under ground level, out of sight. Up on the surface, it looks as if the project has stalled.\nNot until this preliminary foundation work has been laid does the form of the building begin to take shape. First, structural steel is anchored to the foundation walls, outer walls go up, a roof goes on, and we begin to see the result of all of the preparatory work. At this point, the project moves quickly with windows and\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndoors, siding and landscaping, and the building looks much as it did in the artists’ conceptualization. When the building is completed, it is dedicated and put to use. If the preparation work was done carefully and correctly, the building will stand solidly for many, many years.\nIt is much the same way with a musician learning a new piece of music, or, for that matter, learning an instrument. Initially the student is excited to learn a new piece and be able to play it like the masters. But first there is real work that needs to take place. Hours upon hours of time must be devoted to the process of learning the piece. Fingering must be written into the score; phrasings, articulations, and manual changes must all be determined and practiced. Left hand, right hand, and (in the case of us organists) feet need to be coordinated. Like laying the foundation of a building, this is very slow, tedious, time-consuming work that is done out of sight in the practice room (or an empty chapel). It is not at all glamorous or particularly exciting. It is very exacting labor. But eventually patterns and scale figurations are learned, the piece eventually comes together, and, if the preparation was adequate, it can be polished to performance standard relatively easily. The better and more thorough the preparation, the better the final performance will be, and the longer the piece of music will stay with the performer.\nNow, I don’t speak of dusty, difficult, exacting labor to be negative about what this week is about. On the contrary, I offer it as encouragement and something of a promise. The more carefully the groundwork is laid, the more rewarding the final result will be. So dig in with enthusiasm! Be patient with yourself, give yourself a sufficient amount of time and energy to be diligent and work hard, and if you do, you will be amazed at the results. Much like the seed of faith grows up into a tree bearing much fruit (as described in Alma 32), your faith and effort will grow up into a technique that is sure and solid, and your proficiency at the organ will grow and flourish. I wish you all the best as you embark on this journey of inspiration, preparation and progress!\n\n\n\n\n__________\nThere is a saying that states, “T\n\n\nAlena Hall\n\n\n\n\n\nhe music is not in the notes, but in the silence between.” Upon first hearing\n\n\n\n\nthis, in my literalist state, I wondered what kind of fool would say something like that – certainly not a\n\n\n\n\nmusician. But upon more thought and experience I can understand what the author of this quote might have\n\n\n\n\nbeen suggesting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow many of us have ever heard a young student plow through a piece giving little notice or consideration\n\n\n\n\nto that small notated silence called a rest? In contrast, how many of us have paused our breathing as the\n\n\n\n\nconductor on his podium raises his arms, ready to launch his orchestra into the initial downbeat?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the “Organ-World,” music can be found in the silence after an introductory presentation of a chorale, just\n\n\n\n\nprior to a performance of a favorite chorale prelude. Or perhaps, in a French toccata full of furious notes that\n\n\n\n\nclimax on a dissonant dominant chord that dissipates into silence – it is the silence that enhances the\n\n\n\n\ntriumphant moment when major tonality is introduced to conclude the chaos. I personally love that moment\n\n\n\n\nof silence between movements of the Mendelssohn sonatas, Widor symphonies, or a Bach prelude and\n\n\n\n\nfugue. The sound evaporates, a percussive change of stops is heard, and then a small juncture of stillness.\n\n\n\n\nAnd what of that glorious moment in a reverberant cathedral when a stunning recital ends . . . the final chord\n\n\n\n\nhas been released by the organist, but the sound echoes, then vanishes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMusic is notes, pitches, rhythms, sharps, flats, bar lines, staffs, clefs, harmonies, and many other things. But\n\n\n\n\nwhat is music to you? Is it a way to relax? Is it an outlet for stress and anxiety? Is it a way to convey\n\n\n\n\nemotions and thoughts in the deepest way possible? Is it communing with God? Is it a means of helping\n\n\n\n\nshare the Holy Spirit? I am certain that every person here has been moved in deep ways by music.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a musician you become the instrument that conveys what it is the music has to say. The notes can be\n\n\n\n\nboring and stagnant or they can dance with life and passion. A hymn can be played in a way that hypnotizes\n\n\n\n\nthe congregation and no thought is given to the words. Yet even an amateur organist who is well-prepared\n\n\n\n\ncan share the abundance of spirit a hymn has to offer. And so music is not merely sound, it is emotion, it is\n\n\n\n\nfeeling. Music is also discipline. It is consistent effort. And it is practicing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI remember the first time I realized that you could practice the organ. It was the summer that I turned twelve\n\n\n\n\nyears old and it had never occurred to me that our church organist might come to the church during the week\n\n\n\n\nto practice. I was ecstatic about the idea of being able to have the organ all to myself. My wise piano\n\n\n\n\nteacher, who also served as our ward organist, arranged for me to have unlimited access to our church and\n\n\n\n\nits organ. He also offered free organ lessons in addition to the paid piano lessons he was giving me. The\n\n\n\n\nonly catch was practice hours. To receive the free organ lessons, I had to practice two hours a day on the\n\n\n\n\norgan, in addition to the two hours a day he required on the piano. I accepted the challenged and practiced\n\n\n\n\ndiligently for two months. At the end of those two months, this cunning man moved and I became the new\n\n\n\n\nward organist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis experience began my journey into organ playing. Some of you have become organists out of love for\n\n\n\n\nthe instrument or its literature, or as a means of developing your God-given talents. Some of you, have been\n\n\n\n\nfiguratively tossed to the wolves in that your congregation needs an organist and you are it. We all have\n\n\n\n\ndesires to be a better organist, even if our journeys began for different reasons. Progression at the organ\n\n\n\n\noccurs in two ways: learning and practicing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo let’s tie this all together. You are here this week to learn. You will learn pedal techniques, manual\n\n\n\n\ntechniques, practice techniques, registration guidelines, rules of theory, shortcuts, tips, do’s and don’ts of\n\n\n\n\nevery sort. And hopefully in the midst of all this technical “stuff”, you will experience the silent moments\n\n\n\n\nlike those I described. Moments of beauty and delight, compelling and gratifying.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe real work begins at the close of this workshop. The learning should continue but progress will be made in the practice room. Think of this workshop as the notes, rhythms and technicalities of the music. The silence then is the coming year of practice in which your passion for music increases along with your command of the instrument. You will find as I have found that there really is much music to be found in the silence. I’ve always felt the music department here should adopt BYU’s motto with one slight change: “enter to learn, go forth to practice.”\n\n\n\n\nMay God bless you in your efforts.\n_ _________\n\n\n\n\nBrian Mathias\n\n\n\n\nI’m grateful for the opportunity to share a few of my thoughts with you this morning. As I’ve pondered over what “words of wisdom” I might share with you, the topic that has continually been upon my mind is why learning to play the organ is worth our time. Since I began teaching at this workshop in 2010, I have been inspired by the stories I hear from workshop attendees regarding why they come to this workshop. I meet many people who have recently been called as a ward organist, and come here to try and learn just enough to help them stay afloat in their new callings. A few years ago, I met a brother from Canada who had many years of professional experience as a church organist, but had recently joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and came simply in hopes of learning more about music in our church. Still others have been coming to this workshop since before it was the BYU Organ Workshop, and come each year to get their yearly dose of motivation, encouragement, and instruction. Your stories and enthusiasm for this instrument have been an annual source of inspiration to me, and frequently serve to remind me of why I chose to pursue organ in the first place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe live in a world where many things compete for our time for our time every day—some of them menial, and others of great importance. I feel confident that we could all agree that amid all the things we are responsible for, it is often difficult to carve out time to improve our organ playing. For most of us, playing the organ is not the most important responsibility in our lives, and it may not even make the top ten. However, we make time to do it, and for many different reasons. This morning, I would like to share why I feel that working to improve our skills is worth the sacrifice of time it requires.\nFor several years, I have been impressed by the following line from the music section of the Church Handbook: “Congregational singing has a unique and often underused power for unifying members as they worship together” (Handbook 2, 14.4.3., emphasis added). Why is this power “often underused”? In many cases, it is because the members of our congregations simply are not participating. Cultural changes of the last twenty to thirty years have created a society in which many people do not sing, and many possess no inclination toward sacred music. Additionally, many people are simply distracted by conversations with others, the ever-greater pull of smartphones, and attending to the needs of children. Perhaps most fatally, many (and perhaps most) people in our congregations have never actually experienced the power of good congregational singing, and therefore see no compelling reason to participate.\nSadly, we live in a time when this power is needed more than ever. Our religious convictions are increasingly being viewed by the world as second-class convictions, and the Christian way of life is quickly coming to be regarded as “outdated.” It is gradually becoming more difficult to be a faithful follower of Jesus Christ. In order to maintain our faith amid the storm that surrounds us, we need the strength and renewal that our weekly worship can provide. We need to be nourished by the spirit of God. We need to feel at one with our brothers and sisters in the cause of Christ.\nThis, I feel, is where our organ playing comes in. While many people are currently choosing not to participate in congregational singing, that doesn’t mean they can’t be persuaded. A well-prepared and confidently-played hymn introduction can do much to invite participation. Appropriate registration can help people sense the message of the hymn text as they sing. Thoughtful attention to phrasing can help those who sing understand old words in a new way. Well-prepared, thoughtful organ playing encourages singing, and uniting in song invites the Spirit of the Lord in a powerful way. I think we have already experienced that power this morning, and I’m confident that we will continue to experience it throughout this week.\nWhile it’s easy to get bogged down by the mechanics of playing the organ and the many challenges that confront us at each step of our progress, we should always keep in mind the tremendous impact our efforts can have on the people we serve. This, in my opinion, makes every hour of practicing our pedaling or polishing our hymn playing worthwhile. We may never fully know the impact of our efforts on the members of our congregations, but I assure you that the time each of us spend to hone our craft is time spent in humble service to our brothers and sisters, many of whom come to worship in desperate need of nourishment. Let us all give appropriate time to the improvement of our skills, so that they may be used to make the unique power of congregational singing not “underused,” but a weekly source of strength.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t2016\n\t\tEmpty tab.

What a blessed lot we are! What a noble and unique calling we have: to lift souls through the matchless power of inspiring music in the worship of our Heavenly Father and His Son, our Savior and Redeemer! Do we fully appreciate the heavenly gift we literally hold in our hands and feet — the gift of bringing the harmony, unity and peace of heaven directly to the hearts of Heavenly Father’s children? Music aligns the very molecules of our soul which vibrate in harmony with the air around us to bring us a measure of the eternal unity and harmony that pervades heaven. We actually feel the peace of heaven in our souls. Truly, music is rightly called “The Divine Art.”\nPonder with me, if you will, the unique characteristics of our particular musical instrument, the organ. Its profound, gentle low tones we sometimes feel more than we hear. Its sustained, unwavering still small voice can whisper so subtly that we must be still to hear it, and yet the glorious splendor of its unwaveringly powerful chords – tuned vibrations from lowest to highest musical range – bring the almighty power of God and the glorious exalted splendor of our eternal home back before our spiritual eyes. Is it any wonder that such god-like qualities caused the great 19th and 20th century French organist and composer Charles Marie Widor to call the organ “The voice of God!”\nDuring the next few days you have special opportunity to further develop and hone your abilities to use this wonderful voice in the service of Heavenly Father. If you put your prayerful heart and soul into your work, you will bear testimony to all who worship just as surely as those who stand at the pulpit. If you seek to ever more effectively sing the inspired words of our hymns through the organ’s voice, then the songs of the righteous will truly be a prayer unto the Lord.\nAs a long-standing member of the Church’s Musical Instrument Selection Committee or MISC, may I now speak about the organs that we play in our meetinghouses. Please forgive me for perhaps boring you with detailed information, but experience has shown that many of you have questions regarding official Church policies. I hope that this citing of “chapter and verse” will be helpful to you. If you do not catch all of it you desire this morning, I’m told by Dr. Cook that this keynote address will be posted on the BYU Organ Workshop website.\nFor those few of you blessed to play pipe organs in your buildings, the Church’s official policy as found in the Operations \u0026 Maintenance Policy Point Manual on page 39 under “Replacement Standards” is: “Pipe organs should be maintained as required and not replaced.” If problems are identified such as broken parts or insufficient quality of sound, the organ is to be renovated using “Pipe Organ Renovation Guidelines” also found in the Policy Point Manual. These Pipe Organ Renovation Guidelines specify additions such as multiple memories, celeste duplexed on Swell and Great manuals, mutations including 2 2/3’ and 1 3/5’, chorus reed at 16’ as well as 8’ and 4’ pitches on manual and pedal, sufficient pedal foundations at 16’ and even 32’ pitch using digital stops if necessary and\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaximum flexibility of existing pipe ranks, including finish voicing to correct rough and uneven pipe speech and to transform it into smooth and warm sound.\nMost of you, however, play digital organs each Sunday. The quality and variety of sound found in our digital organs has vastly improved over the 25 years that I have sat on the MISC. We have been blessed to work closely with our digital organ vendors Allen, Johannus and formerly Rodgers to produce custom 2-manual LDS instruments that have unusually comprehensive specifications. Eight foot and four foot string and flute celestes create the “still, small voice” with soft 32’ pedal perhaps felt more than heard. Beautifully colorful imitative solo reeds such as English Horn, Krummhorn, Clarinet, Oboe and French Horn sing reverent melodies, as do open and capped flutes at 16’, 8’, 4’, 2 2/3’, 2’ and 1 3/5’ pitches. A full chorus of principals from 16’ through mixtures with the added celestial fire of chorus reeds at 32’, 16’, 8’ and 4’ pitches sound the full musical range to invoke the splendor and power of God’s glory. We hope you will not be afraid to explore and use these voices to sing the hymns into the hearts of the people.\nUseful examples which you may use as models for such registration combinations should be factory preset into memories 1, 2, 15 or 16 of our LDS digital instruments built since 1999. A printed “Preset Registrations” sheet was shipped with each of these instruments along with the Owner’s Manual. You may also download these Preset Registration sheets which include basic registration instructions by visiting lds.org and clicking on “Scriptures and Study,” then “Music,” then “Accompanying Others,” then “Playing the Organ” and scrolling down and clicking onto “Owner’s Manuals for Church Organs.”\nWe are aware that some of you are playing older digital instruments which do not allow the variety, flexibility or quality of sound found in our organs built in the last decade or two. If you long for a newer instrument and wonder what the replacement guidelines might be, here they are quoted directly, again from the Operations \u0026 Maintenance Policy Point Manual, page 38 under “Replacement Standards” for electronic organs: “Age based electronic organ replacement should be on a case by case basis. Consider the following guidelines: –replace organs 33 years old and older.”\nReplacement may be also justified if the organ is in poor condition. “Poor Condition” is defined as: “The organ no longer produces a quality sound as designed and shows substantial mechanical and outer-case damage. The organ will not work properly without major repairs.”\nShould replacement be deemed justified, you might like to be aware of the two “Replacement Directives” printed at the bottom of page 38:\n\nReplace only with full-sized electronic organs found in the Purchasing Reference Guide (PRG). [I would add that there are two approved organs from which to choose: Allen model LD34A and Johannus model WM47-LDS.]\nEncourage priesthood leaders to involve unit organists in selecting the new organ from the PRG.\n\nNow may I share a few of my thoughts on accompaniment of congregational hymns which is the most important part of your role as a church organist. It can make such a wonderful difference to your playing if you can sing the words of the hymn in your heart as you play! Spend some time pondering the words. The closer they are to being memorized, the less you will need to keep one eye referencing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthem as you play the notes. Conversely, the better you know the notes, the more easily you can concentrate on the words. To a certain degree they can shape your articulation and phrasing. Certainly they should influence your registration!\nWhen I was an undergraduate organ student here at BYU I was called as organist for BYU 65th Ward. We met in the auditorium of the old Joseph Smith Memorial Building which seated maybe 1000 or more people and housed the old 80-plus rank four-manual Austin pipe organ which was taken out of the Salt Lake Tabernacle when the new Æolian-Skinner was installed in 1948. As I was called, the 65th Ward Bishopric counseled me, “This is a large organ and we are a small congregation. Please do not use too much of the organ or it will blow us away!” So I started hymn introductions and first verses with less organ than I personally desired – in this case secondary principals without mixtures. As the hymn progressed from verse to verse I gradually added stops. The congregation’s singing gradually increased as the organ built with each verse. Guess what! By the last verse of a big hymn I was using full organ and they were singing their hearts out! Time after time I was told by my fellow ward members how blessed we were to have that large and wonderful organ for our sacrament meetings. So the secret for hymns of praise is: Start conservatively and build with each verse until the final verse includes 32’ pedal reed chorus, manual 16’ reed chorus and, of course, mixtures.\nWhat about meditative hymns such as sacrament hymns? May I share with you two rather unorthodox registrations I use in my ward for a verse or two of a sacrament hymn? I love the rather somber but round, warm and soothing sound of what the French call fonds d’orgue, that is the foundation stops of the organ combined without any upper work. Pull on and couple together all 8’ principals, flutes and strings without celestes, maybe adding a 4’ flute or two and you should have a profound “voice of God” kind of sound that works for the first verse of a sacrament hymn. And, by the way, if you use this sound on the Great manual to play a hymn tune down an octave in the tenor range with your right hand while your left hand accompanies with strings and celeste on the Swell manual, you will hear a very useful and sacred prelude sound reminiscent of General Conference.\nMy second registration is definitely unorthodox for hymn accompaniment. I save it for the occasional ethereal verse of a sacrament hymn such as the second verse of hymns 181 and 182 which speak of “rev’rence sweet” and of joining “the heav’nly throng.” For such ethereal verses I sometimes combine and couple together all 8’ and 4’ strings with celestes. Only bolster the sound with an 8’ flute or principal if necessary.\nWhile we’re considering registration of sacrament hymns, may I suggest that not all verses of every sacrament hymn call for a subdued registration. More than a few of our sacrament hymns end with an exultant verse which calls for an exultant registration through mixture and reeds. A classic example is the final verse of “While of These Emblems We Partake:”\nBut rise triumphant from the tomb,\nAnd in eternal splendor bloom,\nFreed from the pow’r of death and pain, With Christ, the Lord, to rule and reign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI doubt you could show me a more triumphant verse in all hymnody! It seems to me that the power of these words is denied unless your registration lifts up the congregation. Yes, I would use Hymn Preset General 10 – full organ, including 32’ reed to “…rise triumphant from the tomb.”\nOther final exultant sacrament hymn verses I would urge you to consider include hymn numbers 175-6-7, 183-4, and 192 \u0026 195. A building registration during the final lines of hymns 172, 181 and 193 seems appropriate.\nThe Brethren have recently called on us to renew our commitment to making the sacrament portion of our worship more meaningful. Your inspired registration of the sacrament hymn can directly contribute to this sacred experience.\nFinally, I cannot leave the subject of congregational hymn accompaniment without touching on the matter of appropriate embellishment of the printed hymn harmonization. Some of you may have noticed that I am unable to get through all verses of General Conference rest hymns without adding at least a few passing tones and occasionally reharmonizing a chord of two for emphasis, particularly during the last verse. My plan is to play the first verse straight, then gradually unfold embellishments as the hymn builds through successive verses. I am more conservative in this endeavor at General Conference than when playing for sacrament meeting. Reharmonization and even an interlude with transposition up a step can be very inspiring for exultant hymns sung in your own congregation. Such practices I heartily endorse. Hymn singing is meant to be a powerful experience!\nIt has been an honor to speak to you about such a sacred trust as we all have as church musicians. The Church is so blessed to have you who are so dedicated to improving your talents to bring organ music to the hearts of our worshipers. That you are dedicating a week of your time and money to be here to receive this remarkable training is proof of your commitment to the Work of the Lord. May you go forth with His blessing to inspire and impart what you have learned to the training of others, especially of the younger generation, in your wards and stakes. Know that we love you and appreciate you and pray for you.\nIn the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t2018\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\nBrian Mathias, DMA\n\n\n\nKeynote Address\nBYU Organ Workshop 2018\n\n\n\nGood morning, everyone. It’s wonderful to look out and see many familiar faces as well as many new ones! This is my ninth year at this workshop, and though my role will be somewhat different this year than in previous years, I consider it a great honor to be here with you. For many years, I have drawn great inspiration from the people that come to this workshop. Your dedication to this marvelous instrument and the sacrifices you make to be here are so admirable and are a great reminder to me of why I love the organ. Before I start into my remarks for today, I want to let you know how much I love and admire the people you’ll be learning from this week. The instructors of this workshop are some of my closest friends and I hold them in highest respect. I encourage you to take every opportunity to learn from them this week. They have much to offer, and your lives will be enriched by the time that you spend with them.\nThose of you who have been coming to the Organ Workshop for some time are aware that my life has undergone some rather drastic changes since we sat here one year ago listening to Clay Christiansen give the keynote address. At that time, I was an adjunct faculty member here at BYU. The Tabernacle Choir had posted an open position, but had not yet begun reviewing applications. If I look a little older and more haggard than when you saw me last year, it’s because I spent the last four months of 2017 practicing and nervously waiting, which culminated in an audition that I never wish to repeat, followed by more nervous waiting, followed by two weeks of major secret keeping, followed by four months of teaching at BYU and working with the Tabernacle Choir simultaneously, followed by a trip to France with the BYU organ department, followed by moving (twice!), followed by the Tabernacle Choir’s\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClassic Coast Tour in June. I should also mention that my first few months with the Tabernacle Choir included two complete performances of Handel’s Messiah, April General Conference, and recording a new CD! It has been an eventful year at the Mathias home. After all that, I’m happy to report to you that my children still recognize me and my wife still likes me! As a family, we feel tremendously blessed by the events of the last year. It has been a year full of great challenges and even greater blessings.\nIn this magnificent whirlwind, I’ve had to learn many things very quickly. As I have pondered what I might share with you today, I felt it fitting to relate to you some of the things I’ve learned during these first several months on the job in hopes that some of them might be useful to all of you, wherever you might be in your organ playing.\nTo provide context for these remarks, I will briefly describe what being a Tabernacle Organist entails. As most of you are probably aware, the Tabernacle Choir has three full-time and two part-time organists. Our most important duty is to accompany the Mormon Tabernacle Choir in General Conference, weekly Music and the Spoken Word broadcasts, concerts, and rehearsals. In addition to our work with the choir, we perform daily organ recitals on Temple Square and provide music for various other events on Temple Square as needed. All of this requires a lot of practicing, and that is where we spend a great deal of our time each week.\nFor many years as an observer of the tabernacle organists, I marveled at the high standard of excellence that has been a part of the Temple Square musical tradition for decades. As a newcomer to this group, I am keenly aware of the burden that is now mine to help uphold that standard. Sadly, I have learned over the last several months that at least one of the Tabernacle Organists is very, very human! But I have also learned a great deal by pushing myself harder\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthan ever before and have been the recipient of much-needed grace in times of need. Today I would like to share with you some of the insights gained from these experiences.\nThe first lesson might seem obvious, but it is that thorough preparation is essential to a good performance. This is a concept I’ve believed in and practiced for a long time. However, I’ve come to appreciate it more deeply in recent months as I have been working to hone my practice habits to a higher degree than ever before. As I’m sure you can imagine, the Tabernacle organ bench is, at times, a very hot seat. The pressure of playing—particularly as a soloist—on a live TV broadcast can be immense. I will never forget sitting on the bench during my first broadcast this last March. As the time approached for my solo—the fiery final movement of Charles-Marie Widor’s sixth organ symphony—I saw, out of the corner of my eye, a cameraman getting into position just a few feet to my left. In that instant, the reality of what I was about to do struck me in a rather profound and terrifying way! Thankfully, I had been warned by my colleagues about this, and I had some sense of the mental struggle I was about to go through. What we all need during performance, whether it’s in a recital, a church meeting, or even a routine practice session, is to remain focused, calm, and confident. You know as well as I do that this is extremely difficult at times, and that is where good preparation will save you. In this moment, I was very grateful that I had spent the last few weeks drilling this piece of music in every imaginable way—slowly, in sections, in various combinations of parts, in alternate rhythms, recording myself, playing for others, etc. This preparation gave me a very reliable foundation to fall back on even in moments when I struggled to maintain perfect focus.\nThis experience also taught me the value of a different kind of preparation. In the weeks leading up to my first day on the bench, my colleagues encouraged me to practice playing through the entire broadcast from start to finish. This is something I wouldn’t have thought to\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngive much attention to, but it proved to be one of the most valuable steps in my preparation. Because most Music and the Spoken Word broadcasts today proceed without any announcement between pieces, we often have a very short amount of time to get prepared to begin the next piece on the program. Immediately after releasing the final chord of the Widor Final, I had to jump right into “His Yoke is Easy,” from Handel’s Messiah with no time to rearrange the music on the rack. This proved to be a challenging transition, but with plenty of practice, it was perfectly manageable. Playing through the entire broadcast, from “Gently Raise the Sacred Strain” to the iconic “As the Dew from Heaven Distilling,” a few dozen times in the days leading up to that first Sunday morning was a lifesaver, and it’s something I’ve made a consistent habit of since that time. You might consider giving this a try for your next sacrament meeting. Practicing in this way is a great way to circumvent silly errors such as starting on the wrong memory level, hitting the wrong piston, forgetting to turn pages between pieces, etc., and can also help you prepare for the mental transition required to move from one piece to the next. Building these habits in a less pressure-filled situation (when no one is watching you!) has been very helpful to me, and I think many of you may benefit from trying it as well.\nThe next lesson is that there is never enough time to prepare, so it’s important to use practice time efficiently. As I mentioned earlier, between daily recitals, choir rehearsals, broadcasts, and concerts, we are performing on a nearly daily basis. There is new music to learn and practice every week. I’m sure many of you feel the same way. Whether you’re preparing hymns for sacrament meeting, repertoire pieces for an Independent Study course, or technical exercises for an upcoming lesson, it’s hard to squeeze everything into the time you have available. For this reason, we would all benefit from examining the way we use our practice time. Allow me to offer a few suggestions for this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, use goals to structure and plan your practice. I often keep a list of every piece I need to be working on, ordered by priority. At the start of my practicing each day, I look over this list and make a plan for what I want or need to accomplish with each piece and how I will divide my time in order to reach that goal. Of course, it frequently happens that I underestimate the amount of time a particularly tricky passage might take or perhaps manage to make the progress I need on another passage in less time than estimated. Your goals will need to have a little flexibility, especially in the beginning. The important concept here is that goal-oriented practice encourages a mindset in which you are not simply sitting down to practice for an hour— you are sitting down to accomplish a specific goal or set of goals. With this mindset, every minute counts for something. If you’ve never practiced in this way, I encourage you to try it. You will be surprised how much you can accomplish.\nSecond, use practice techniques that are efficient. In my roughly twelve years of teaching, I found that the majority of students that came to me had never really been taught practice habits beyond the “sit down and play it a bunch of times” method. If this is your current routine, listen carefully this week, and I’m certain that you’ll come away with some helpful strategies and techniques that will help you practice more effectively. Organ playing is a complex task, and trying to play everything at once at full tempo often amounts to “practicing” mistakes that later have to be corrected. It is a well-known fact that the shortest distance between any two points is a straight line. If we apply this rule to our practicing, we might find that learning the right notes with the correct fingering by slowing down, playing hands or feet separately, or working in small sections allows us to take the shortest, most direct path to accomplishing our goal. Many people feel that they don’t have time to do this kind of practicing because it takes too long. Personally, I\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndon’t have time to not do this kind of practicing. It is the fastest way I know of to learn music, and that’s something we can all appreciate and use in our lives.\nLooking at this issue from the opposite direction, I would also encourage you to make sure that you’re not taking more time than is actually needed to learn something to the point that you can perform it confidently and securely. We all know the feeling of having a hard time putting something down during a practice session. “Just one more time,” we tell ourselves. And then another. And another. I’m absolutely in favor of being thorough, but at a certain point, the repetition can become counterproductive and take precious time away from other pieces that might need some attention. Work until you accomplish your goal, and then move on to whatever is next.\nOnce you have made your preparations, it’s time to actually perform, by which I mean to play in any situation where other people are listening, which nearly always influences our thoughts as we play. This could be a sacrament meeting or other worship service, an organ lesson or recital, or something else. The BYU School of Music offers a course in performance psychology taught by Dr. Jon Skidmore. One of the essential concepts he teaches is that at a certain point, you have to say to yourself “my preparation for this performance is complete.” At that point, you have to let go and acknowledge that the time for preparing is over and the time for performing has come. Dr. Skidmore then encourages students to adopt a mindset of being “Bold, Confident, and Free” when performing.\nWhen I arrived at the University of Kansas as a new doctoral student, I had established a routine of meticulous, methodical practice and tried to carry that approach over into my performance. Imagine my surprise when during one of my first lessons with Professor James Higdon, I was playing Jehan Alain’s Litanies when I heard him yell from the back of the recital\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhall “Faster!” In this lesson and many subsequent lessons, we discussed how there is a time to be slow and methodical, and there is also a time to let it rip. To be clear, I’m not suggesting that we should perform recklessly, too fast, or overly loud. What I mean to say is that performance is not the time to be worrying about making mistakes—that’s what practicing is for. Performing is about making music and sharing something with your listeners that can’t be communicated any other way. Practice diligently when it’s time to practice, and when it’s time to perform, let it rip!\nThe third lesson is that there is tremendous value in asking questions to people who have answers. Between the Tabernacle Choir’s conductors and organists, I work with a small group of some of the most capable, knowledgeable, and talented musicians I have encountered anywhere. This is an incredible privilege, and one I am most grateful for. The combined wisdom and professional experience in this group is mind boggling. In the choir office, there is a closet of shared organ accompaniments. For each piece in the choir’s repertoire, there is a score that is prepared to reduce or eliminate page turns. Each score is also marked with the registrations previously used, manual changes, and various other helpful notations. As a newcomer to the staff, this closet is a goldmine containing decades of battle-tested performance knowledge. Even with this great resource available, I still often have questions about various things. Taking the time to ask my colleagues has provided many opportunities to not only get my questions answered, but to learn lots of other things that I didn’t even know I needed to learn. You will have many opportunities to ask questions this week, and I encourage you to do so. You might worry that your question is a “stupid” question, but in reality, there’s a good chance that someone sitting near you is wondering the same thing! You will rarely have the opportunity to be surrounded by so many experienced organists, so don’t let the week pass without getting answers to your burning questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFourth, never let pride or ego get in the way of making good music. I’ve just described the incredible depth of talent and accomplishment among the choir staff. What’s even more impressive is that they all get along—something that highly accomplished musicians are not always known for! This is so essential to accomplishing the Tabernacle Choir’s mission “to bring joy, peace, and healing to its listeners.” While there are varied and diverse opinions among the staff on various musical issues, what they uniformly understand is that making good music is more important than being “right.” Given that so many of our efforts as organists are directed toward the act of worship, we would all do well to adopt this philosophy. Our congregations, choirs, and we ourselves will be uplifted in a more profound way as a result.\nThe last lesson is something I’ve already alluded to: that at some point (and hopefully sooner than later), we must come to accept our own imperfection. Despite our best efforts, at the end of the day, we are human. Have you ever made a mistake in General Conference? I have! If your Sunday morning mistakes are keeping you awake at night, I encourage you to enjoy a peaceful night of sleep on me. Of course, I don’t intend to make light of this or suggest that we approach our responsibilities casually. I practiced more for April General Conference than almost any event I can remember. However, it is true that despite my best preparations, I didn’t play quite as cleanly as I would have liked to. But that’s the beautiful thing: when we give our best efforts, we receive the gift of grace from a loving God and his beloved Son, who made an infinite sacrifice in order that we could be strengthened in our weakness, and our imperfections made perfect. Because of this, we can miss a few notes and still make a perfect offering by giving the best of ourselves and accepting his grace where we fall short.\nThe day before my first Music and the Spoken Word broadcast in March, I went to the Tabernacle to practice in the afternoon. After running through everything several times, I felt that\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI had done everything I could do, but I was still struggling to utter the all-important phrase “my preparation for this performance is complete.” Given the magnitude of what I was about to do, I felt that no amount of practicing would be sufficient for me to feel like I had done enough. While sitting in my office packing up to go home, I recalled a scripture from the 84th section of the Doctrine and Covenants that I was previously familiar with, but which suddenly took on an entirely new meaning: “And whoso receiveth you, there I will be also, for I will go before your face. I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.”\nI truly believe that what we do at the organ each week matters. When we combine our efforts with the Spirit’s power, we have the ability to strengthen our brothers and sisters in profound and even life-changing ways. I hope and pray that the Lord will be with each of you in your efforts to serve the Lord’s children through your service on the bench of the King of Instruments in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t2019\n\t\tEmpty tab.

  "inline_text": "Carol Deanne Peine Dean (1947-2018) was an avid teacher and student of the organ for over 30 years. She played her first solo organ recital at age 40 and, at age 51, received a Master of Music in Organ Performance and Pedagogy from Brigham Young University. \n In 1986, she and her husband, Dana, bought a home within the boundaries of the Provo Central Stake, not knowing beforehand that the building was to soon house the magnificent Bigelow pipe organ, Opus 16. She immediately became a protégé and private student of Dr. Douglas Bush, an organ professor at BYU and the instigator of the Bigelow installation in his stake. Carol once stated that “Dr. Bush’s knowledge of and respect and love for Johann Sebastian Bach and his music changed my life forever.” Her other respected mentors and teachers were Dr. Darwin K. Wolford, Dr. Richard Elliott, Dr. Don Cook, and Dr. Parley Belnap. \n Carol was a popular instructor at church, chapter, and BYU organ workshops. She also taught hundreds of young people in group organ classes at BYU, which, she said “was the most defining preparation I could have possibly had for ‘my life’s calling’—to teach the hymns of the Church, especially to beginners, and to help as many pianists as possible become proficient, service-playing organists.” She regularly traveled from Draper to Santaquin to her students’ churches and homes to give private lessons. \n Carol served the Utah Valley AGO chapter, beginning in 1988, as secretary/newsletter editor (twice for a total of 14 years), officer over educational concerns from 1990 to 1991, dean from 1992 to 1994, and board member at large until her death. She was always ready and willing to help the guild in any way that was needed, organizing events, such as the annual Bach recitals, and preparing refreshments for many chapter meetings. Carol is a certified Collegue in the AGO. \n Carol published and distributed at cost, Hymns from the LDS Hymnal Marked for the Organ, a landmark collection of every hymn in the 1985 hymnal, with notations for fingering, articulation, and pedaling to assist pianists to learn how to correctly play the hymns on the organ. The book is available through a former student, Jennifer Morgan, by emailing ldsorganistblog.

She played her first solo organ recital at age 40 and, at age 51, received a Master of Music in Organ Performance and Pedagogy from Brigham Young University.\nIn 1986, she and her husband, Dana, bought a home within the boundaries of the Provo Central Stake, not knowing beforehand that the building was to soon house the magnificent Bigelow pipe organ, Opus 16. She immediately became a protégé and private student of Dr. Douglas Bush, an organ professor at BYU and the instigator of the Bigelow installation in his stake. Carol once stated that “Dr. Bush’s knowledge of and respect and love for Johann Sebastian Bach and his music changed my life forever.” Her other respected mentors and teachers were Dr. Darwin K. Wolford, Dr. Richard Elliott, Dr. Don Cook, and Dr. Parley Belnap.\nCarol was a popular instructor at church, chapter, and BYU organ workshops. She also taught hundreds of young people in group organ classes at BYU, which, she said “was the most defining preparation I could have possibly had for ‘my life’s calling’—to teach the hymns of the Church, especially to beginners, and to help as many pianists as possible become proficient, service-playing organists.” She regularly traveled from Draper to Santaquin to her students’ churches and homes to give private lessons.\nCarol served the Utah Valley AGO chapter, beginning in 1988, as secretary/newsletter editor (twice for a total of 14 years), officer over educational concerns from 1990 to 1991, dean from 1992 to 1994, and board member at large until her death. She was always ready and willing to help the guild in any way that was needed, organizing events, such as the annual Bach recitals, and preparing refreshments for many chapter meetings. Carol is a certified Collegue in the AGO.\nCarol published and distributed at cost, Hymns from the LDS Hymnal Marked for the Organ, a landmark collection of every hymn in the 1985 hymnal, with notations for fingering, articulation, and pedaling to assist pianists to learn how to correctly play the hymns on the organ. The book is available through a former student, Jennifer Morgan, by emailing ldsorganistblog. Read Carol’s 2013 Super Saturday keynote address, Forge Ahead with Faith, here.\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n",

  "inline_text": "The modern pipe organ is a time-honored musical instrument that makes use of mechanical, electrical, electronic, and/or pneumatic (air-driven) components. A BLOWER supplies air through WIND LINES and RESERVOIRS to WIND CHESTS, where air is kept at a certain pressure for use on demand. The wind chests contain valves that open or shut the air flow into the PIPES, which set atop holes in the chests. Once a pipe is sounded, it can be softened in effect only if it is part of an ENCLOSED division (contained in a box with louvers). The louvers may be closed, thereby softening the sounding pipes (like closing the door on a practice room) by closing the EXPRESSION PEDAL. An enclosed division is also known as an “expressive division,” whereas an EXPOSED division (all sides are open) or an ENCASED division (only one side is open) are called “non-expressive divisions.” If the pipe is part of an exposed or encased division, it cannot be made to sound louder or softer by the organist. But an exposed, encased, or enclosed division can be made louder or softer by adding or retiring stops, thereby increasing the number of pipes sounding per key depressed.\nCOMBINATIONS of stops may be pulled by hand, or may be set into memory and recalled through the use of the COMBINATION ACTION (including the THUMB PISTONS, TOE STUDS, SET BUTTON, and MULTI-LEVEL MEMORY). \n The pipe organ consists of several major components: \n The CONSOLE is the control center of the organ. The organist pulls a STOP (a flute, for example) to potentially activate a RANK (set) of pipes that belongs to a particular DIVISION of the organ (the Great, Swell, or Pedal, for example). That division is played from a certain MANUAL (a keyboard for the hands) or from the PEDALS (a keyboard for the feet).\nThe single pipe that sounds middle-C from that rank will sound only if the stop for that rank is pulled AND the KEY middle-C on the appropriate manual is depressed. In other words, when the key is depressed, a valve underneath the pipe opens, allowing air into the pipe IF the appropriate stop has been pulled. The KEY ACTION (mechanical, electric, or electro-pneumatic) has some influence over the manner in which the pipe speaks. A pipe produces sound as a column of air vibrates (like a whistle–called a FLUE pipe) or as a reed vibrates (like a clarinet–called a REED pipe). \n COMBINATIONS of stops may be pulled by hand, or may be set into memory and recalled through the use of the COMBINATION ACTION (including the THUMB PISTONS, TOE STUDS, SET BUTTON, and MULTI LEVEL MEMORY). \n Organ “Keyboards”–Manuals and Pedals\nThe piano has one keyboard. The small standard church organ has three–two manual keyboards of 61 keys each, called “manuals” for short, and a pedal keyboard of 32 keys, referred to as “the pedals.” The first manual, the lower one closest to the performer, is “the Great,” while the second manual, the upper one, is “the Swell.” Each manual and the pedal keyboard corresponds to its respective “division” of the organ. A division consists of several ranks (sets) of pipes located within close proximity to one another in the organ case. \n THE GREAT DIVISION: This first and lower manual (located closer to the performer) controls the main division of the organ, referred to also as “the Great.” The main principal chorus, often considered the “backbone” of the organ, is central to the Great division. This is usually a non-expressive division, meaning that its pipes are not contained in a box with louvers that can be opened and shut. In that case, volume can only be controlled by the addition and retirement of Great stops. However, some church organs are installed with most of the organ pipework–even the Great–contained in the swell box. \n THE SWELL DIVISION: This second and higher manual (located just above the Great) controls a secondary division of the organ, referred to as “the Swell.” A secondary, more flute-dominated chorus, and a fiery reed (trumpet) chorus are often characteristic of the Swell division. By definition, the Swell is an expressive division, meaning that its pipes are contained in a large box with louvers that can be opened and shut. An EXPRESSION PEDAL (also called the SWELL PEDAL) controls the position of these louvers. Volume can also be controlled by the addition and retirement of Swell stops. \n THE PEDAL DIVISION: The pedal keyboard contains keys that correspond to the first 32 keys of the manual keyboard (C to g”). Middle c, therefore, is the right-most pedal c. While the basic pitch of the manuals is concert pitch (“eight-foot pitch”), the basic pitch of the Pedal division is one octave below (“sixteen-foot pitch”). The deep vibrations that can be felt and that are so typical of the large pipe organ are characteristic of the Pedal division. \n At either side of the manual keyboards are wooden frames called KEY CHEEKS. The key cheeks for the lowest manual can be grasped by both hands for steadiness when playing pedal solos or exercises. Some organists prefer to rest the hands on the bench to either side of the body, resulting perhaps in a less stable position but a more relaxed appearance when playing pedal solos. \n The Expression (“Swell”) Pedals and the Crescendo Pedal\nThe tilting pedals, located above the pedal keys, offer two completely different ways of affecting a crescendo or diminuendo. The difference between their functions should be understood thoroughly. \n THE EXPRESSION (“SWELL”) PEDALS control volume by opening and closing louvers. These louvers are the only opening of a large box containing a division of the organ. (On a 2-manual organ, this is the Swell division, but occasionally some ranks of the Great and Pedal divisions are contained in the Swell box. In addition, 3- and 4-manual organs often contain an enclosed Choir and/or Solo division.) As a rule the expression pedal it is located just above pedal (tenor) e and f. The normal position for the swell pedal of a pipe organ is fully open (the top of the pedal “to the metal,” like the accelerator of a car) in order to sound in proper balance with the Great division. However, it can be closed quickly or slowly for expressive effects, or to adjust the balance between certain Great and Swell combinations. \n On some electronic organs the swell pedal serves as a volume control for the entire organ–not just the Swell division. On others there may be a separate expression pedal that controls the Great and Pedal divisions. In both of these cases the expression pedals work like the volume control of a radio. If distortion occurs when these volume controls are fully open, its optimum position must be determined by trial and error every time the organ is played. However, a technician can regulate most electronic expression pedals to avoid distortion so that “full open” might approximate the “full open” volume of a pipe organ. \n The expression pedal is most conveniently operated by the right foot, but the left can be used if the right foot is busy. Often the most dramatic crescendo effect occurs as the louvers first begin to open, so a smooth crescendo may require a very gradual opening at first, with some acceleration following. If a long crescendo or diminuendo is required while both feet are called upon alternately to play, place the free foot on the expression pedal and open or close it as smoothly as possible in small “installments.” \n THE CRESCENDO PEDAL controls volume by adding and retiring stops electronically in a pre-determined order. If the organ is so equipped, the crescendo pedal is located just to the right of the expression (swell) pedal, and is often raised slightly to help identify it “by feel.” As the pedal is opened, the softest stops are added one by one, maintaining some balance between the divisions. When fully opened, nearly all the stops that contribute to the ensemble are added. As the pedal is closed, the stops are retired in reverse order. Only the stops that are physically drawn will remain sounding when the crescendo pedal is fully closed. The normal position for the crescendo pedal is fully closed (the top of the pedal pulled back towards you). Due to the organist’s limited control in determining the stops that are brought into use with the crescendo pedal, and due to the infrequent use it finds in organ literature, the crescendo pedal is used far less often than the expression pedal. Some organs have no crescendo pedal at all. \n In order to operate either the swell or the crescendo pedal with optimum control, place the foot flat on the pedal and adjust its position with the entire foot, not just the toe. The operation of these pedals should be considered from the time you begin working out the pedaling of an organ piece. Practice operating these pedals as diligently as you would practice the notes, and allow the ear to guide the feet towards a musically satisfying result. \n Stop Action\nThe earliest organs (into the fifteenth century) had grown to the point that several pipes sounded whenever a key was depressed. It was the idea of “cutting off” or “stopping” selected pipes from sounding that resulted in the term “stop.” In modern organs all stops are actually devices that select sets (ranks) of pipes from which an individual pipe will be sounded whenever a key is depressed. STOP TABS are lined up in a STOP RAIL, usually located above the highest manual. STOP KNOBS (and occasionally stop tabs) are are located on the STOP JAMBS on either side of the manuals. A stop is “pulled” to activate the rank(s) with which it is associated, or “retired” to deactivate the rank(s). Like key actions, there are several types of stop action: \n MECHANICAL stop actions use stop knobs or levers only (not stop tabs). When the stop knob is pulled, a mechanical linkage between the console and the windchest brings a rank of pipes into potential action. Like mechanical key action, this is the oldest type, and offers a more “honest” form of contact between the organist and the music. However, mechanical stop actions are difficult to control by most types of combination action (see below). They also require a reasonably close proximity between console and pipework. \n ELECTRIC ASSIST stop actions use electric motors on the windchest to help move the stop action. The connection between stop knob or stop tab and the windchest is electric, so the console can be separated from the pipework. \n ELECTRIC stop actions replace all mechanical stop action parts with electrical contacts and magnetic valves. The console can be located away from the pipework. Lighted rocker tabs, found in some electronic organs, would be included in this category. \n Key Action\nWhen a key is depressed, a valve opens underneath a particular pipe. The means of connecting the key with that valve or “pallet” is called the key action. Most organs are designed with some form of the following types of key action: \n MECHANICAL (ÒTRACKER”) key action, the oldest type, features a mechanical connection from the key to the valve (or “pallet”). This action is usually designed with lengths of wooden “trackers” and roller bars to distribute the action to the proper pipe. Since the organist is opening the pallet through a truly mechanical connection, he enjoys a small amount of control over the way the pipe begins to speak. This is one important benefit of tracker key action. The console must be located close to the pipework, however, for the key action to remain tight and responsive. (Shorter trackers make possible a more responsive action.) But this is rarely the best position for hearing the organ as the choir, congregation, or audience would hear it. \n DIRECT ELECTRIC key action utilizes electrical key contacts and magnetic pipe valves. Since the action is not mechanical, any control over the pipe speech is sacrificed. In fact, the magnetic valve opens even more abruptly than with a tracker or electro pneumatic action, resulting in a somewhat harsh initial attack as each pipe sounds. The console may be placed any distance from the pipework without affecting the responsiveness of the action, allowing for more favorable console placement. Direct electric actions are less expensive to produce than mechanical or electro-pneumatic actions. Electronic organs always use electric key action. \n ELECTRO-PNEUMATIC key action combines air pressure and electrical circuits in the connection between key and pipe valve. The organist has no contol over pipe speech, but the harsh initial attack of the direct electric key action is minimized in an electro pneumatic key action. As in organs with direct electric key action, the console may be separated from the pipework. Electro pneumatic key actions tend to be more difficult to maintain than either of the other two types. \n Pistons (Pre-sets) and the Combination Action\nThe art of organ registration (the selection and combination of organ stops, or “registers”) has been facilitated greatly by the invention of mechanical, pneumatic, electrical, and now solid state combination actions. In the era of organ performance prior to this, the organist was required to make all stop changes by hand, or to recruit one or more registration assistants. Obviously, this inflicted a great limitation on the types and number of changes in organ sound that were possible in the course of a performance–even with the help of an assistant. In modern times many organs are built with a combination action, making possible the setting or “memorization” of any combination of stops, and the possibility of recalling that combination by pressing a single THUMB PISTON or TOE STUD. Of course, the combination action is used to facilitate stop-changing. It should not be used for stop changes that can be made just as easily by hand–a basic skill required of every organist. \n Here are the components of the combination action. Learn how the system works by trying it on your instrument: \n 1. THUMB PISTONS. Most organs have several buttons underneath the manuals that are labeled with numbers. These THUMB PISTONS are your contact point with the combination action. When pressed, each of these pistons recalls the combination of stops that it was most recently called upon to remember. These are called GENERAL PISTONS (“generals”), because they memorize and recall stops on all divisions. Generals are usually located to the far left or to the center underneath one manual or the other. LOCAL PISTONS (“locals”) memorize and recall only the stops on one division. The Swell locals are located underneath the Swell, those for the Great are found underneath the Great, and those for the Pedal are usually on TOE STUDS to the right of the crescendo or expression pedals. However, toe studs more often function as duplicates of the general thumb pistons, offering the choice of using the feet when the hands are too busy to reach a thumb piston. Most organs have USER-ADJUSTABLE pistons, where new combinations may be set on pistons by the performer as desired. Some organs, mostly older electronic organs, are equipped only with FACTORY PRE-SETS, meaning that the combinations recalled by the pistons are pre-set at the factory, and cannot be changed by the performer. In this case, you will not find a SET BUTTON (usually labeled with an “S”, and usually the lower left-most thumb piston) and any attempts at resetting a piston will be futile. Still other organs, particularly very small ones and many organs with mechanical key and/or stop actions, have no combination action at all. In this case, any registration change must be made by hand either by the performer or with the help of a registration assistant. \n 2. SET BUTTON. The function of the set button is best learned by using it. Press the CANCEL button. Choose the following stops: Pedal Principal 16′ and Octave 8′; Swell Trompette 8′; Great Principal 8′ and Octave 4′. Press the SET button and hold it in while you press general piston 3. Now release both. See if your combination is set correctly by retiring all stops, or by pressing the CANCEL (marked by the number “0”) button. Any indication that a piston or stop is selected should be blank. Play a chord and see that nothing is playing. Now recall your combination by pressing piston 3 without pressing the set button. The stops you chose should now be selected. Play a chord on the Swell–you should hear the 8′ Trompette. You should hear your Principal 8′ and Octave 4′ on the Great, with Pedal 16′ and 8′ stops to balance. If not, perhaps you didn’t hold in the set button, or didn’t retire the stops, or have pressed some piston other than the one that was set. Try it again if you were not successful the first time. \n On most instruments, the piston allows the organist to see what was set on it. However, on some organs there is no way to identify the stops that were drawn and set on any piston other than by using trial and error, your ear and your memory. Let’s refer back to what was set for piston 3, and set a slightly bigger combination on piston 4. Remember the stops we set on piston 3 (check yourself by looking in the paragraph above) and draw them again. Now add to that combination on the Swell: Prestant 4′ and Nazard 2 2/3′; on the Great: Super Octave 2′; and on the Pedal: Great to Pedal. Press the SET button and hold it in while you press piston 4. Check yourself: retire all stops, recall the combination by pressing piston 4 and playing a chord. Is the combination on each manual a bit bigger than that of piston 3? Try it by pressing piston 3 and by playing a chord, then while holding the chord pressing piston 4. Now cancel, draw all the stops used for piston 4, and add a stop that will give the Great a little more brilliance. Set the new combination on piston 5 and check yourself in the same manner as before, but expecting an increase of brilliance in the Great and the Pedal only (the Swell has not been changed from piston 4 to piston 5). Now turn off the organ, wait a few seconds, and turn it back on. Check your pistons, and note that they survived the power outage. Organs are designed to remember the combinations even after being powered down. \n 3. MULTI-LEVEL MEMORY. Press the thumb piston called “M[emory] 2.” Clear all stops and press piston 3. Do you hear the Swell Trompette 8′? Probably not. Piston 3–and all of the others–remembers the combination you set on memory 1 (which is in force when the memory 2 piston is disengaged) and some other combination for memory 2. We say that the organ has a multi-level memory, or two memories. Frequently a standard buildup, much like our progression from piston 3 through piston 5, will be set and kept on one memory, reserving the other(s) for customized combinations. The computer age has made possible anywhere from two to literally hundreds of memories on a single organ. Multiply the number of memories by the number of (general) thumb pistons, and you have the total number of possible combinations that can be set. If an organ has 6 pistons and 2 memories, it has 12 combinations total. If there are 15 pistons and 4 memories, 60 combinations are possible. 10 pistons and 8 memories yield 80 combinations. At the Salt Lake Tabernacle, with so many staff and guest organists, there is great need for many combinations. The organ has 20 pistons and 255 memories. How many combinations are possible? (5,100) \n 4. COMBINATION LOCK-OUT. Some combination actions include a device to help protect your combinations from accidental (or not accidental) loss of your pre-set combinations. This may be a keyed lock (many pipe organs use this type), or a button with the word “lock” or something similar. If you need to set combinations on the keyed-lock type and the key is missing, the organist should be able to provide you with one. If not, write to the organ manufacturer for replacement keys (most locks use theby the same manufacturer use a standard key). When the key is turned, the combination action can be re-set. When the key is turned back and can be taken out, the combination action is locked in and no pistons can be set. \n Reversibles\nAlthough they appear identical to thumb pistons and toe studs, “reversibles” serve an entirely mechanical function independent from the combination action. The oft-used Great to Pedal reversible can serve to illustrate. When it is depressed the first time, the Great to Pedal coupler is drawn (in most cases the drawknob or stop tab actually moves into “on” position). When depressed the second time, the action is “reversed,” retiring the coupler back into “off” position. Depressing a Great to Pedal reversible repeatedly simply brings the drawknob or stop tab in and out or up and down. \n The Great to Pedal reversible is especially useful in maintaining a balance between manual and pedal. If you are playing on the Great, your pedal combination might include Subbass 16′, Swell to Pedal, and Great to Pedal. If you change manuals from Great to Swell, balance can be achieved simply by depressing the Great to Pedal reversible, which retires the Great to Pedal, and leaves only the Subbass 16′ and the Swell to Pedal. As you return to the Great, you depress the reversible again and the Great to Pedal coupler is drawn. Of course, the coupler can also be drawn or retired by hand–without use of the reversible. \n Although the Great to Pedal is the most common reversible, there are others. The “Sforzando” or “Tutti” reversible, often marked “SFZ” or “T”, brings on all stops that contribute to the ensemble–essentially full organ. The Sforzando reversible is usually designed to add the final crowning glory to the fully open crescendo pedal. The combination that is brought into action by the Sforzando reversible can usually be adjusted by a technician. If it is too shrill to be usable, work with your technician. First try having the organ tuned (or at least the higher-pitched stops and the reeds). If it is still too shrill, see if a supercoupler or a very high pitched stop can be eliminated from the Sforzando reversible. \n The Great to Pedal and Sforzando are the only reversibles common to small organs. Larger instruments may include reversibles for the Swell to Pedal and other couplers, as well as other important stops or devices. \n Adjustable Bench\nDue to the great variation in leg length from person to person, some means of adjusting bench height is required if several organists are to share a single bench. Most organ benches are cut to an average length, meaning that only those with medium-length legs will be able to play with a proper position at the organ. Those with longer legs will have to lean back to lift their feet up when moving from key to key. Lower back pain is a common complaint of taller organists who do not have an adjustable bench. Some relief can be achieved for taller organists by sliding one or two 1″ x 4″ boards underneath each bench leg. This will bring the distance from the top of the bench to the pedal key surface more in line with the length of the leg from the knee to the heel. \n Those with shorter legs will tend to slide forward on the bench to reach pedal keys. This results in serious organ playing problems. It is impossible to balance when an organist must slide forward. Some very short organists, in order to avoid slipping forward onto the pedals, have to dedicate one foot to supporting the body by pressing against the pedalboard framework. Such extreme measures result in choppy, one-footed pedal technique. Short-legged organists who do not have to slide so far forward often avoid playing the heels because they must press the leg into the bench–and even raise the body upward–to get the heel down far enough to play the key. \n Ideally an adjustable bench should be purchased when several organists of various heights play a single instrument. If this is impossible (they cost approximately $1000), each leg of the bench should be cut down at least 3/4″, then special bench risers or four finished 1″ x 4″ boards should be provided to bring the bench back up to standard height or 3/4″ higher for taller organists. \n The pipe organ produces sound by directing a steady supply of air through specially-designed pipes. It requires one pipe per key, 61 pipes per manual rank, and approximately 9 ranks for the smallest church organ. At $10,000 to $20,000 or more per rank, a pipe organ becomes a major investment. Due to the great initial expense of such an instrument, attempts have been made to economize wherever possible. With the advent of electronics came the idea of substituting an electronically-produced tone for the tone of a sounding pipe. In recent years, a side-benefit of the rise of the computer has been the capacity to “digitally sample” pipe sound (to approximate it through digital reproduction of the wave form). \n The most advanced electronic organ today is still, at best, an electronic substitute for the true pipe organ sound. But the increased accessibility offered through lower initial cost, smaller size, and relatively easy transportability has resulted in their placement in numerous homes, churches, colleges, and even some concert halls.On Campus Students\n\n\tMusic Majors\n\t\n\t\tDegree Programs\n\t\tCareer and Income Opportunities\n\t\tAdmissions and Scholarship\n\t\tStudents\n\t\n\n\tNon-Music Majors\n\t\n\t\tGroup Organ Study\n\t\tPrivate Organ Study\n\t\tOrgan Registration\n\t\n\n\n \n Music Majors\n\t\n\t\tDegree Programs\n\t\tCareer and Income Opportunities\n\t\tAdmissions and Scholarship\n\t\tStudents\n\t\n \n Degree Programs \n Career and Income Opportunities \n Admissions and Scholarship \n Students \n Non-Music Majors\n\t\n\t\tGroup Organ Study\n\t\tPrivate Organ Study\n\t\tOrgan Registration\n\t\n \n Group Organ Study \n Private Organ Study \n Organ Registration \n Off Campus Students\n\n\tFinding An Organ Teacher\n\tBYU Programs for Off-Campus Organists (Organ Certification)\n\t\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 1-2\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 3-6\n\t\tRepertoire for BYU Independent Study Organ Courses\n\t\n\n\tContinuing Your Organ Training PDF\n\tMaterials Needed For Independent Study Organ Classes PDF\n\tBYU Organ Workshop\n\tOrganTutor\n\tMentor Instructions\n\n \n Finding An Organ Teacher \n BYU Programs for Off-Campus Organists (Organ Certification)\n\t\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 1-2\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 3-6\n\t\tRepertoire for BYU Independent Study Organ Courses\n\t\n \n Independent Study Organ Levels 1-2 \n Independent Study Organ Levels 3-6 \n Repertoire for BYU Independent Study Organ Courses \n Continuing Your Organ Training PDF \n Materials Needed For Independent Study Organ Classes PDF \n BYU Organ Workshop \n OrganTutor \n Mentor Instructions \n Events\n\n\tBYU Organ Workshop\n\tPipe Organ Study Tour of Germany\n\tAGO Events\n\t\n\t\tUtah Valley Chapter AGO\n\t\tSalt Lake City Chapter AGO\n\t\n\n\n \n BYU Organ Workshop \n Pipe Organ Study Tour of Germany \n AGO Events\n\t\n\t\tUtah Valley Chapter AGO\n\t\tSalt Lake City Chapter AGO\n\t\n \n Utah Valley Chapter AGO \n Salt Lake City Chapter AGO \n Ward Organists\n\n\tThe New Ward Organist\n\tWard Organist Training\n\t\n\t\tOrgan Training Outlines\n\t\n\n\tTraveling Organ Workshops\n\tOrgan Training Resources PDF\n\tU of U Group Organ Instruction\n\tUsing OrganTutor PDF\n\tFree Accompaniment PDF\n\n \n The New Ward Organist \n Ward Organist Training\n\t\n\t\tOrgan Training Outlines\n\t\n \n Organ Training Outlines \n Traveling Organ Workshops \n Organ Training Resources PDF \n U of U Group Organ Instruction \n Using OrganTutor PDF \n Free Accompaniment PDF \n Workshops\n\n\tOnline Training Sessions\n\t2021 BYU Organ Workshop\n\tTraveling Organ Workshops\n\n \n Online Training Sessions \n 2021 BYU Organ Workshop \n Traveling Organ Workshops \n Info \u0026 Reference\n\n\tOrgan Training Resources PDF\n\tCarol Dean\n\tContinuing Your Organ Training\n\tDouglas E.

A BLOWER supplies air through WIND LINES and RESERVOIRS to WIND CHESTS, where air is kept at a certain pressure for use on demand. The wind chests contain valves that open or shut the air flow into the PIPES, which set atop holes in the chests. Once a pipe is sounded, it can be softened in effect only if it is part of an ENCLOSED division (contained in a box with louvers). The louvers may be closed, thereby softening the sounding pipes (like closing the door on a practice room) by closing the EXPRESSION PEDAL. An enclosed division is also known as an “expressive division,” whereas an EXPOSED division (all sides are open) or an ENCASED division (only one side is open) are called “non-expressive divisions.” If the pipe is part of an exposed or encased division, it cannot be made to sound louder or softer by the organist. But an exposed, encased, or enclosed division can be made louder or softer by adding or retiring stops, thereby increasing the number of pipes sounding per key depressed.\nCOMBINATIONS of stops may be pulled by hand, or may be set into memory and recalled through the use of the COMBINATION ACTION (including the THUMB PISTONS, TOE STUDS, SET BUTTON, and MULTI-LEVEL MEMORY).\nThe pipe organ consists of several major components:\n\nWIND SUPPLY–the blower, wind lines, and reservoirs that make a steady supply of pressurized air available for any pipe at any time.\nWIND CHESTS–wooden boxes upon which the pipes set, containing valves and other selection devices that control the air flow into the pipes.\nPIPE WORK–pipes of metal or wood of various sizes and shapes that produce tones of various pitches and tone qualities. Pipes are arranged in ranks (sets) of one pipe per key (61 pipes per manual rank, 32 per pedal rank). Ranks are grouped into 2, 3, or more divisions (Great, Swell, and Pedal, for example).\nCONSOLE–the control center of the organ, where the key and stop actions originate, where other assisting devices are controlled (the expression and crescendo pedals, for example), and where the combination action is housed.\nSTOP ACTION–the means of selecting sets (ranks) of pipes from which an individual pipe will be sounded whenever a key is depressed (mechanical, electric assist, electric, or pneumatic). Stop tabs are lined up in a “stop rail” above the highest manual; stop knobs are located on the key jambs on either side of the manuals. A stop is “pulled” to activate the rank(s) with which it is associated, or “retired” to deactivate the rank(s).\nCOMBINATION ACTION–a memory system allowing instant recall of various combinations of stops at the touch of a button (thumb pistons or toe studs).\nKEY ACTION–the means of connecting the key with the valve underneath the pipes (mechanical or “tracker” action, electric action, pneumatic action, or electro-pneumatic action).\n\nTHE ORGAN CONSOLE\nThe CONSOLE is the control center of the organ. The organist pulls a STOP (a flute, for example) to potentially activate a RANK (set) of pipes that belongs to a particular DIVISION of the organ (the Great, Swell, or Pedal, for example). That division is played from a certain MANUAL (a keyboard for the hands) or from the PEDALS (a keyboard for the feet).\nThe single pipe that sounds middle-C from that rank will sound only if the stop for that rank is pulled AND the KEY middle-C on the appropriate manual is depressed. In other words, when the key is depressed, a valve underneath the pipe opens, allowing air into the pipe IF the appropriate stop has been pulled. The KEY ACTION (mechanical, electric, or electro-pneumatic) has some influence over the manner in which the pipe speaks. A pipe produces sound as a column of air vibrates (like a whistle–called a FLUE pipe) or as a reed vibrates (like a clarinet–called a REED pipe).\nCOMBINATIONS of stops may be pulled by hand, or may be set into memory and recalled through the use of the COMBINATION ACTION (including the THUMB PISTONS, TOE STUDS, SET BUTTON, and MULTI LEVEL MEMORY).\nOrgan “Keyboards”–Manuals and Pedals\nThe piano has one keyboard. The small standard church organ has three–two manual keyboards of 61 keys each, called “manuals” for short, and a pedal keyboard of 32 keys, referred to as “the pedals.” The first manual, the lower one closest to the performer, is “the Great,” while the second manual, the upper one, is “the Swell.” Each manual and the pedal keyboard corresponds to its respective “division” of the organ. A division consists of several ranks (sets) of pipes located within close proximity to one another in the organ case.\nTHE GREAT DIVISION: This first and lower manual (located closer to the performer) controls the main division of the organ, referred to also as “the Great.” The main principal chorus, often considered the “backbone” of the organ, is central to the Great division. This is usually a non-expressive division, meaning that its pipes are not contained in a box with louvers that can be opened and shut. In that case, volume can only be controlled by the addition and retirement of Great stops. However, some church organs are installed with most of the organ pipework–even the Great–contained in the swell box.\nTHE SWELL DIVISION: This second and higher manual (located just above the Great) controls a secondary division of the organ, referred to as “the Swell.” A secondary, more flute-dominated chorus, and a fiery reed (trumpet) chorus are often characteristic of the Swell division. By definition, the Swell is an expressive division, meaning that its pipes are contained in a large box with louvers that can be opened and shut. An EXPRESSION PEDAL (also called the SWELL PEDAL) controls the position of these louvers. Volume can also be controlled by the addition and retirement of Swell stops.\nTHE PEDAL DIVISION: The pedal keyboard contains keys that correspond to the first 32 keys of the manual keyboard (C to g”). Middle c, therefore, is the right-most pedal c. While the basic pitch of the manuals is concert pitch (“eight-foot pitch”), the basic pitch of the Pedal division is one octave below (“sixteen-foot pitch”). The deep vibrations that can be felt and that are so typical of the large pipe organ are characteristic of the Pedal division.\nAt either side of the manual keyboards are wooden frames called KEY CHEEKS. The key cheeks for the lowest manual can be grasped by both hands for steadiness when playing pedal solos or exercises. Some organists prefer to rest the hands on the bench to either side of the body, resulting perhaps in a less stable position but a more relaxed appearance when playing pedal solos.\nThe Expression (“Swell”) Pedals and the Crescendo Pedal\nThe tilting pedals, located above the pedal keys, offer two completely different ways of affecting a crescendo or diminuendo. The difference between their functions should be understood thoroughly.\nTHE EXPRESSION (“SWELL”) PEDALS control volume by opening and closing louvers. These louvers are the only opening of a large box containing a division of the organ. (On a 2-manual organ, this is the Swell division, but occasionally some ranks of the Great and Pedal divisions are contained in the Swell box. In addition, 3- and 4-manual organs often contain an enclosed Choir and/or Solo division.) As a rule the expression pedal it is located just above pedal (tenor) e and f. The normal position for the swell pedal of a pipe organ is fully open (the top of the pedal “to the metal,” like the accelerator of a car) in order to sound in proper balance with the Great division. However, it can be closed quickly or slowly for expressive effects, or to adjust the balance between certain Great and Swell combinations.\nOn some electronic organs the swell pedal serves as a volume control for the entire organ–not just the Swell division. On others there may be a separate expression pedal that controls the Great and Pedal divisions. In both of these cases the expression pedals work like the volume control of a radio. If distortion occurs when these volume controls are fully open, its optimum position must be determined by trial and error every time the organ is played. However, a technician can regulate most electronic expression pedals to avoid distortion so that “full open” might approximate the “full open” volume of a pipe organ.\nThe expression pedal is most conveniently operated by the right foot, but the left can be used if the right foot is busy. Often the most dramatic crescendo effect occurs as the louvers first begin to open, so a smooth crescendo may require a very gradual opening at first, with some acceleration following. If a long crescendo or diminuendo is required while both feet are called upon alternately to play, place the free foot on the expression pedal and open or close it as smoothly as possible in small “installments.”\nTHE CRESCENDO PEDAL controls volume by adding and retiring stops electronically in a pre-determined order. If the organ is so equipped, the crescendo pedal is located just to the right of the expression (swell) pedal, and is often raised slightly to help identify it “by feel.” As the pedal is opened, the softest stops are added one by one, maintaining some balance between the divisions. When fully opened, nearly all the stops that contribute to the ensemble are added. As the pedal is closed, the stops are retired in reverse order. Only the stops that are physically drawn will remain sounding when the crescendo pedal is fully closed. The normal position for the crescendo pedal is fully closed (the top of the pedal pulled back towards you). Due to the organist’s limited control in determining the stops that are brought into use with the crescendo pedal, and due to the infrequent use it finds in organ literature, the crescendo pedal is used far less often than the expression pedal. Some organs have no crescendo pedal at all.\nIn order to operate either the swell or the crescendo pedal with optimum control, place the foot flat on the pedal and adjust its position with the entire foot, not just the toe. The operation of these pedals should be considered from the time you begin working out the pedaling of an organ piece. Practice operating these pedals as diligently as you would practice the notes, and allow the ear to guide the feet towards a musically satisfying result.\nStop Action\nThe earliest organs (into the fifteenth century) had grown to the point that several pipes sounded whenever a key was depressed. It was the idea of “cutting off” or “stopping” selected pipes from sounding that resulted in the term “stop.” In modern organs all stops are actually devices that select sets (ranks) of pipes from which an individual pipe will be sounded whenever a key is depressed. STOP TABS are lined up in a STOP RAIL, usually located above the highest manual. STOP KNOBS (and occasionally stop tabs) are are located on the STOP JAMBS on either side of the manuals. A stop is “pulled” to activate the rank(s) with which it is associated, or “retired” to deactivate the rank(s). Like key actions, there are several types of stop action:\nMECHANICAL stop actions use stop knobs or levers only (not stop tabs). When the stop knob is pulled, a mechanical linkage between the console and the windchest brings a rank of pipes into potential action. Like mechanical key action, this is the oldest type, and offers a more “honest” form of contact between the organist and the music. However, mechanical stop actions are difficult to control by most types of combination action (see below). They also require a reasonably close proximity between console and pipework.\nELECTRIC ASSIST stop actions use electric motors on the windchest to help move the stop action. The connection between stop knob or stop tab and the windchest is electric, so the console can be separated from the pipework.\nELECTRIC stop actions replace all mechanical stop action parts with electrical contacts and magnetic valves. The console can be located away from the pipework. Lighted rocker tabs, found in some electronic organs, would be included in this category.\nKey Action\nWhen a key is depressed, a valve opens underneath a particular pipe. The means of connecting the key with that valve or “pallet” is called the key action. Most organs are designed with some form of the following types of key action:\nMECHANICAL (ÒTRACKER”) key action, the oldest type, features a mechanical connection from the key to the valve (or “pallet”). This action is usually designed with lengths of wooden “trackers” and roller bars to distribute the action to the proper pipe. Since the organist is opening the pallet through a truly mechanical connection, he enjoys a small amount of control over the way the pipe begins to speak. This is one important benefit of tracker key action. The console must be located close to the pipework, however, for the key action to remain tight and responsive. (Shorter trackers make possible a more responsive action.) But this is rarely the best position for hearing the organ as the choir, congregation, or audience would hear it.\nDIRECT ELECTRIC key action utilizes electrical key contacts and magnetic pipe valves. Since the action is not mechanical, any control over the pipe speech is sacrificed. In fact, the magnetic valve opens even more abruptly than with a tracker or electro pneumatic action, resulting in a somewhat harsh initial attack as each pipe sounds. The console may be placed any distance from the pipework without affecting the responsiveness of the action, allowing for more favorable console placement. Direct electric actions are less expensive to produce than mechanical or electro-pneumatic actions. Electronic organs always use electric key action.\nELECTRO-PNEUMATIC key action combines air pressure and electrical circuits in the connection between key and pipe valve. The organist has no contol over pipe speech, but the harsh initial attack of the direct electric key action is minimized in an electro pneumatic key action. As in organs with direct electric key action, the console may be separated from the pipework. Electro pneumatic key actions tend to be more difficult to maintain than either of the other two types.\nPistons (Pre-sets) and the Combination Action\nThe art of organ registration (the selection and combination of organ stops, or “registers”) has been facilitated greatly by the invention of mechanical, pneumatic, electrical, and now solid state combination actions. In the era of organ performance prior to this, the organist was required to make all stop changes by hand, or to recruit one or more registration assistants. Obviously, this inflicted a great limitation on the types and number of changes in organ sound that were possible in the course of a performance–even with the help of an assistant. In modern times many organs are built with a combination action, making possible the setting or “memorization” of any combination of stops, and the possibility of recalling that combination by pressing a single THUMB PISTON or TOE STUD. Of course, the combination action is used to facilitate stop-changing. It should not be used for stop changes that can be made just as easily by hand–a basic skill required of every organist.\nHere are the components of the combination action. Learn how the system works by trying it on your instrument:\n1. THUMB PISTONS. Most organs have several buttons underneath the manuals that are labeled with numbers. These THUMB PISTONS are your contact point with the combination action. When pressed, each of these pistons recalls the combination of stops that it was most recently called upon to remember. These are called GENERAL PISTONS (“generals”), because they memorize and recall stops on all divisions. Generals are usually located to the far left or to the center underneath one manual or the other. LOCAL PISTONS (“locals”) memorize and recall only the stops on one division. The Swell locals are located underneath the Swell, those for the Great are found underneath the Great, and those for the Pedal are usually on TOE STUDS to the right of the crescendo or expression pedals. However, toe studs more often function as duplicates of the general thumb pistons, offering the choice of using the feet when the hands are too busy to reach a thumb piston. Most organs have USER-ADJUSTABLE pistons, where new combinations may be set on pistons by the performer as desired. Some organs, mostly older electronic organs, are equipped only with FACTORY PRE-SETS, meaning that the combinations recalled by the pistons are pre-set at the factory, and cannot be changed by the performer. In this case, you will not find a SET BUTTON (usually labeled with an “S”, and usually the lower left-most thumb piston) and any attempts at resetting a piston will be futile. Still other organs, particularly very small ones and many organs with mechanical key and/or stop actions, have no combination action at all. In this case, any registration change must be made by hand either by the performer or with the help of a registration assistant.\n2. SET BUTTON. The function of the set button is best learned by using it. Press the CANCEL button. Choose the following stops: Pedal Principal 16′ and Octave 8′; Swell Trompette 8′; Great Principal 8′ and Octave 4′. Press the SET button and hold it in while you press general piston 3. Now release both. See if your combination is set correctly by retiring all stops, or by pressing the CANCEL (marked by the number “0”) button. Any indication that a piston or stop is selected should be blank. Play a chord and see that nothing is playing. Now recall your combination by pressing piston 3 without pressing the set button. The stops you chose should now be selected. Play a chord on the Swell–you should hear the 8′ Trompette. You should hear your Principal 8′ and Octave 4′ on the Great, with Pedal 16′ and 8′ stops to balance. If not, perhaps you didn’t hold in the set button, or didn’t retire the stops, or have pressed some piston other than the one that was set. Try it again if you were not successful the first time.\nOn most instruments, the piston allows the organist to see what was set on it. However, on some organs there is no way to identify the stops that were drawn and set on any piston other than by using trial and error, your ear and your memory. Let’s refer back to what was set for piston 3, and set a slightly bigger combination on piston 4. Remember the stops we set on piston 3 (check yourself by looking in the paragraph above) and draw them again. Now add to that combination on the Swell: Prestant 4′ and Nazard 2 2/3′; on the Great: Super Octave 2′; and on the Pedal: Great to Pedal. Press the SET button and hold it in while you press piston 4. Check yourself: retire all stops, recall the combination by pressing piston 4 and playing a chord. Is the combination on each manual a bit bigger than that of piston 3? Try it by pressing piston 3 and by playing a chord, then while holding the chord pressing piston 4. Now cancel, draw all the stops used for piston 4, and add a stop that will give the Great a little more brilliance. Set the new combination on piston 5 and check yourself in the same manner as before, but expecting an increase of brilliance in the Great and the Pedal only (the Swell has not been changed from piston 4 to piston 5). Now turn off the organ, wait a few seconds, and turn it back on. Check your pistons, and note that they survived the power outage. Organs are designed to remember the combinations even after being powered down.\n3. MULTI-LEVEL MEMORY. Press the thumb piston called “M[emory] 2.” Clear all stops and press piston 3. Do you hear the Swell Trompette 8′? Probably not. Piston 3–and all of the others–remembers the combination you set on memory 1 (which is in force when the memory 2 piston is disengaged) and some other combination for memory 2. We say that the organ has a multi-level memory, or two memories. Frequently a standard buildup, much like our progression from piston 3 through piston 5, will be set and kept on one memory, reserving the other(s) for customized combinations. The computer age has made possible anywhere from two to literally hundreds of memories on a single organ. Multiply the number of memories by the number of (general) thumb pistons, and you have the total number of possible combinations that can be set. If an organ has 6 pistons and 2 memories, it has 12 combinations total. If there are 15 pistons and 4 memories, 60 combinations are possible. 10 pistons and 8 memories yield 80 combinations. At the Salt Lake Tabernacle, with so many staff and guest organists, there is great need for many combinations. The organ has 20 pistons and 255 memories. How many combinations are possible? (5,100)\n4. COMBINATION LOCK-OUT. Some combination actions include a device to help protect your combinations from accidental (or not accidental) loss of your pre-set combinations. This may be a keyed lock (many pipe organs use this type), or a button with the word “lock” or something similar. If you need to set combinations on the keyed-lock type and the key is missing, the organist should be able to provide you with one. If not, write to the organ manufacturer for replacement keys (most locks use theby the same manufacturer use a standard key). When the key is turned, the combination action can be re-set. When the key is turned back and can be taken out, the combination action is locked in and no pistons can be set.\nReversibles\nAlthough they appear identical to thumb pistons and toe studs, “reversibles” serve an entirely mechanical function independent from the combination action. The oft-used Great to Pedal reversible can serve to illustrate. When it is depressed the first time, the Great to Pedal coupler is drawn (in most cases the drawknob or stop tab actually moves into “on” position). When depressed the second time, the action is “reversed,” retiring the coupler back into “off” position. Depressing a Great to Pedal reversible repeatedly simply brings the drawknob or stop tab in and out or up and down.\nThe Great to Pedal reversible is especially useful in maintaining a balance between manual and pedal. If you are playing on the Great, your pedal combination might include Subbass 16′, Swell to Pedal, and Great to Pedal. If you change manuals from Great to Swell, balance can be achieved simply by depressing the Great to Pedal reversible, which retires the Great to Pedal, and leaves only the Subbass 16′ and the Swell to Pedal. As you return to the Great, you depress the reversible again and the Great to Pedal coupler is drawn. Of course, the coupler can also be drawn or retired by hand–without use of the reversible.\nAlthough the Great to Pedal is the most common reversible, there are others. The “Sforzando” or “Tutti” reversible, often marked “SFZ” or “T”, brings on all stops that contribute to the ensemble–essentially full organ. The Sforzando reversible is usually designed to add the final crowning glory to the fully open crescendo pedal. The combination that is brought into action by the Sforzando reversible can usually be adjusted by a technician. If it is too shrill to be usable, work with your technician. First try having the organ tuned (or at least the higher-pitched stops and the reeds). If it is still too shrill, see if a supercoupler or a very high pitched stop can be eliminated from the Sforzando reversible.\nThe Great to Pedal and Sforzando are the only reversibles common to small organs. Larger instruments may include reversibles for the Swell to Pedal and other couplers, as well as other important stops or devices.\nAdjustable Bench\nDue to the great variation in leg length from person to person, some means of adjusting bench height is required if several organists are to share a single bench. Most organ benches are cut to an average length, meaning that only those with medium-length legs will be able to play with a proper position at the organ. Those with longer legs will have to lean back to lift their feet up when moving from key to key. Lower back pain is a common complaint of taller organists who do not have an adjustable bench. Some relief can be achieved for taller organists by sliding one or two 1″ x 4″ boards underneath each bench leg. This will bring the distance from the top of the bench to the pedal key surface more in line with the length of the leg from the knee to the heel.\nThose with shorter legs will tend to slide forward on the bench to reach pedal keys. This results in serious organ playing problems. It is impossible to balance when an organist must slide forward. Some very short organists, in order to avoid slipping forward onto the pedals, have to dedicate one foot to supporting the body by pressing against the pedalboard framework. Such extreme measures result in choppy, one-footed pedal technique. Short-legged organists who do not have to slide so far forward often avoid playing the heels because they must press the leg into the bench–and even raise the body upward–to get the heel down far enough to play the key.\nIdeally an adjustable bench should be purchased when several organists of various heights play a single instrument. If this is impossible (they cost approximately $1000), each leg of the bench should be cut down at least 3/4″, then special bench risers or four finished 1″ x 4″ boards should be provided to bring the bench back up to standard height or 3/4″ higher for taller organists.\nTHE ELECTRONIC ORGAN\nThe pipe organ produces sound by directing a steady supply of air through specially-designed pipes. It requires one pipe per key, 61 pipes per manual rank, and approximately 9 ranks for the smallest church organ. At $10,000 to $20,000 or more per rank, a pipe organ becomes a major investment. Due to the great initial expense of such an instrument, attempts have been made to economize wherever possible. With the advent of electronics came the idea of substituting an electronically-produced tone for the tone of a sounding pipe. In recent years, a side-benefit of the rise of the computer has been the capacity to “digitally sample” pipe sound (to approximate it through digital reproduction of the wave form).\nThe most advanced electronic organ today is still, at best, an electronic substitute for the true pipe organ sound. But the increased accessibility offered through lower initial cost, smaller size, and relatively easy transportability has resulted in their placement in numerous homes, churches, colleges, and even some concert halls.\n",

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Acupressure is a branch of Traditional Chinese Medicine which involves the stimulation of acupuncture points with finger pressure using the power and sensitivity of human touch, rather than inserting needles. This form of healing is non-invasive and gentle. The indications include the vast array of conditions that Chinese medicine has proven to treat effectively. Because acupressure stimulates the body’s natural self-healing abilities, it also works as a great preventative therapy. Generally, the effects of acupressure are less potent than those of acupuncture, and as a result more treatments are needed to get the same results. \n Acupressure is ideal for children. It is gentle, safe, and effective for many conditions, including relief and prevention of colds and flu. Parents can also be taught self-help techniques to use on their child at home. \n Acupressure is also suitable for the elderly suffering from conditions including arthritis, mobility problems, constipation, and poor circulation. \n Certain acupressure points must be avoided during pregnancy. Be sure to tell your practitioner if you are or may be pregnant. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you. Together we implement lasting changes that will improve your energy, balance and health.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n In addition to acupuncture and herbology, cupping therapy has been part of Chinese medicine for over 2,500 years. Originally, animal horn was used for cupping, later on brass, ceramic, and bamboo cups were used. Today, we use glass cups in a variety of different sizes. \n Cupping is like a very deep tissue massage. The practitioner applies heat in a cup and then applies that cup to the body, most commonly on the back. The heat creates a vacuum effect and draws the skin up into the cup. The result is a movement of fresh blood to the area, release of toxins, acupuncture point stimulation, increased circulation of blood and lymph, relaxation of tight muscles, and reduced inflammation. \n Cupping does leave noticeable marks similar to a bruise or hickey that is sometimes referred to as “cup kisses”. Although they can look alarming, they are not painful and will disappear on their own within 3-7 days. \n Most commonly, cupping is used for aches and pains of various types including low back and leg pain, neck and shoulder tension, and fibromyalgia. It also helps open up the chest and benefits the lungs to treat respiratory problems such as cough, bronchitis, asthma, and the like. It can even benefit menstrual problems and digestive problems including stomach aches, vomiting, and diarrhea. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n The spiritual side of acupuncture \n Most people think Esoteric Acupuncture is merely another form of acupuncture treatment. Practitioners may be interested in which acupuncture points to use and how to sequence the needling of those acupuncture sites. Those who are newly introduced to Esoteric Acupuncture may be impressed with the various geometric patterns. Esoteric Acupuncture defines a “way of life.” \n Esoteric Acupuncture is not merely another form of acupuncture treatment. Esoteric Acupuncture defines a “way of life.” This way of life emphasizes the awakening and expansion of our spiritual center (not the same as religions). This way of life includes the importance of understanding the vibrational frequencies of the foods and drinks we ingest. Everything we eat and drink shapes our multiple energy fields. It is important to only ingest foods of the cleanest and highest vibrations. Energy is transported through our hands, fingers and mind through the acupuncture needle into the client. Energy is a transporter of information. What information are you transmitting to your client? \n The phrase Esoteric Acupuncture is broken up into three sections. Esoteric means something that is not readily known. There may be other meanings not understood by the casual reader or those not versed in esoteric teachings. Acupuncture comes from two words. “Acus” is a Latin word that means needle or obelisk. In esoteric teachings, obelisk can also mean a temple. Puncture means to pierce. Therefore, we are piercing your “temple” (your physical body) to activate or to reach something esoteric within. This esoteric “something” is the alignment, strengthening and refining your Heart Center. This Heart Center is the field that opens up infinite possibilities for your journey on planet Earth. We are interested in raising the vibrations of your Heart Center and to connect this center with all your denser frequency fields of consciousness including: your dense physical, etheric, astral and mental fields, plus accessing and activating the buddhic, atmic, monadic and logoic fields of cosnciousness. It is possible for some of you to access solar, galactic and cosmic consciousness with repeated Esoteric Acupuncture treatments. \n There was an inherent Time-lock in the release of Esoteric Acupuncture to Humanity. (Esoteric Acupuncture had its present genesis in 1995, but was not introduce to the public in book format until 1999.) That Time-lock was that the Consciousness of Humanity had to be vibrating at a higher frequency in order to be able to accept and understand the Ageless Wisdom in this New Format. It is important that you be able to quiet the mind to strengthen your Higher Heart Center. Academia is one of the most stubborn institutions for allowing changes to occur. Only those vibrating at a certain frequency will be drawn to Esoteric Acupuncture. Moving away from tradition is not something a society or group will easily accept. \n Externalization of the Hierarchy \n ” A New Humanity is developing with a New and Finer Frequency Pulse for this planet. Are you flowing with the New Pulse or are you stagnant in the Old Frequencies? There will not be one external savior to assist with humanities karma. It will be a group body of dedicated individuals who will, as a group, raise the light quotient of the Earth to assist in the uplifting of humanity. The New Humanity is what I call the Externalization of the Hierarchy. \n Recognize your own power You are the answer for a better planet. Those of you who are reading this are part of the Externalization of the Hierarchy.” \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you. Together we implement lasting changes that will improve your energy, balance and health.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Chronic pain, whether from a pinched nerve, sciatica, arthritis or other conditions can be very frustrating for the sufferer. It is often difficult to treat nerve pain with traditional medications as nerve pain does not respond well to prescription pain relievers, including narcotics. \n Here at One Essence Healing. we treat a range of pain-related conditions, including: \n Any time there is pain in the body, you have sensory nerves which are firing and you might or might not have a structural problem causing the sensory dysfunction. In most cases chronic pain has no structural cause. The problem with most doctors who are not well versed in the field of neurology is their immediate assumption that if you have pain, there must be a structural reason for the pain. In other words, there must be some form of structure, either bone, soft tissue, disc or some object actually pushing on the sensory nerve, causing it to continuously fire. This assumption is not true. \n Actually, in most cases of chronic pain, there are no structural reasons for the pain at all. Yes, your back can look like a corkscrew, but the neural impingement that your doctor is telling you about is inferred from a radiology report. An MRI or X-ray cannot see a nerve. Consequently the medical profession is assuming, based on their idealized knowledge of anatomy, that your pain has to have a structural cause. However, in most cases the sensory nerves are swollen and firing on their own with nothing pushing on them. \n In order for the brain to register pain, there has to be two types of neural signals hitting the brain at about the same time. The first signal is from the sensory nerve or nerves themselves. The second is from the proprioceptive nerves which are also firing right next to the sensory nerves. The proprioceptive nerves tell the brain where your pain is emanating from. If everything is working properly, the brain will release a torrent of what are called enkephalins. These chemicals are the body’s natural pain killers, and they plug up the pain receptor sites in the brain, all along the spine, and on the the capillary beds where you feel the pain. They stop the chronic pain and allow the body to return to normal function. \n Obviously, with those patients who suffer from chronic discomfort, this mechanism is no longer working. There are many reasons the body’s natural pain-relieving mechanism is not working. However, the number one cause appears to be a chronic signal strength problem in the proprioceptive neural tissue. If the neural threshold level (signal strength) is too low, the brain will not know exactly where to release the enkaphalins and thus the pain continues. Acupuncture will raise the signal strength on the proprioceptive pathway and the result is a sudden and dramatic relief from pain. For this reason, we can treat an incredibly wide variety of pain problems (see the list above). \n This technique does have its own problems when a patient’s pain is caused by a structural problem. In this case, there is actual tissue pushing directly on a sensory nerve or group of nerves. Jumping the signal strength on the proprioceptive pathway alone will not solve this type of problem. These patients usually need more invasive procedures, such as surgery. \n Back pain, whether caused by chronic sciatica, a bulging disc, or arthritis is very painful and can be disabling. A person suffering from sciatica has an inflamed sciatic nerve. This nerve starts roughly at the base of the spine, travels down the back of the leg and then stops in your foot. Sciatic pain is difficult to treat because nerve pain does not respond well to painkillers. Sciatica can cause severe, stabbing pain and can make the patient cry out when sudden movements are made. \n Acupuncture works by stimulating the nervous system and allowing for the body to regain balance. There are many scientific studies on acupuncture and the results are conclusive, that acupuncture is effective in relieving certain kinds of pain. \n There are also other ways to relieve back pain without medication. These include physical therapy, and a progressive exercise program that uses both stretching and balance techniques. Back pain may not be completely relieved by exercise or physical therapy alone and that is when alternative treatments become useful. Strengthening the stomach muscles through exercise is a specific way to increase back strength and improve the overall functioning of the low back. \n Shoulder pain is another difficult to treat illness because of the complexity of the shoulder joint. The shoulder is a ball and socket joint, attached together by ligaments and protected by cartilage. If there is ligament damage or the cartilage has worn down, the joint will hurt when it is used. There is no significant way to stop shoulder pain that is caused by worn cartilage without surgery. Acupuncture may help you keep pain at bay while you wait for a surgical procedure. \n Arthritis pain can be felt anywhere in the body where there is a joint, therefore, arthritis pain can be anywhere in the body. Arthritis can be widespread or it can be concentrated in a knee, low back, or shoulder. Arthritis is a very common health ailment for the general public and with early management, arthritis pain does not have to be disabling. You can live with arthritis for a long time without pain if you make changes in your lifestyle that include alternative therapies. \n Those that suffer from arthritis will likely find relief from acupuncture treatments because acupuncture treats the whole body and promotes overall wellness. Arthritis sufferers likely have arthritis in more than one place and analgesics only help for so long. \n Chronic, low grade pain can lead to a decrease in activity and a lack of enjoyment in activities because the pain is just too much to deal with. People that suffer from chronic pain are more prone to depression because they are no longer able to do things that they once enjoyed. They may suffer loneliness and feel that they are suffering alone. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you. Together we implement lasting changes that will improve your energy, balance and health.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n In Oriental medicine the root of excess weight is an imbalance within the body caused by malfunctioning of the spleen and liver organ systems. Acupuncture points, as well as foods and herbs selected to assist with weight loss can directly influence the Qi of the spleen and liver systems and treat the imbalances that have caused weight gain. \n The spleen is responsible for the proper functioning of the digestive system, ensuring that the food we eat is transformed into Qi, the vital substance of life. Disharmony of the spleen will result in symptoms such as fatigue, slow metabolism, water retention, loose stool and a feeling of heaviness. \n The liver’s job is to keep the flow of your body’s Qi, blood and emotions running smoothly. Our modern, fast-paced lifestyle and chronic stress can negatively impact the liver’s ability to function properly and smoothly, which, in turn, can cause the spleen and the entire digestive system to function poorly. One result can be a decrease in your metabolism. Liver disharmony can also cause some of the “triggers” that lead to cravings and compulsive eating. \n Acupuncture and Oriental medicine have been shown to have positive effects on the functioning of the nervous, endocrine and digestive systems. Treatment can help with food cravings and metabolism. These functions all help energize the body, maximize the absorption of nutrients, regulate elimination, control overeating, suppress the appetite and reduce anxiety. \n Acupuncture and Oriental medicine address the issues of over-eating and low metabolism with effective tools to control appetite and increase energy. Energy imbalances are corrected and the digestive and elimination processes are improved so that there is a physical shift in the body to naturally have more energy and desire less food. \n By addressing both the physiological and psychological aspects of weight management concerns, acupuncture and Oriental medicine provide a comprehensive therapy for weight issues that promote better digestion, balance emotions, reduce appetite, improve metabolism and eliminate food cravings. \n Each treatment is customized to the needs of the individual patient. Acupuncture points on the body are chosen for overall well being with the objective of increasing circulation of the blood and Qi (to stimulate the metabolism) and calming the nervous system. Treatments can include a combination of auricular (ear) and body acupuncture, ear tacks or pellets to leave on between treatments, herbs and supplements, abdominal massage, breathing exercises, and food and lifestyle recommendations. \n In addition to treating the root of the imbalance within the body, different acupuncture points may be used for each treatment as different symptoms arise. For instance, if you are experiencing a desire to overeat related to premenstrual syndrome (PMS) one week, then that can be addressed at that week’s appointment. \n The herbs and foods that are chosen during a weight management treatment are for promoting healthy digestion, energizing the body, augmenting Qi, and improving elimination of water, toxins and waste products. Acupuncture points on the abdomen can help improve digestion. They can also help with food absorption and the movement of food through the intestines. \n Deep breathing with visualization can also strengthen will power and be used as a tool to curb hunger and cravings. Most patients report a marked decline in appetite and cravings with acupuncture treatment alone, but special herbs, healing foods and exercises can definitely enhance the efficacy of the treatments. \n Acupuncture and Oriental medicine are powerful tools for achieving a healthy weight, by itself or as a supportive treatment in conjunction with other weight management programs. \n Contact us today and schedule a consultation to see how acupuncture and Oriental medicine can assist you with your weight management goals and help you to live a long, healthy life! \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Gastrointestinal disorders are uncomfortable, painful, sometimes embarrassing, and can often be aided with the help of Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine. Among the gastrointestinal disorders we treat are: \n Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or IBS, is a typical disease pattern that we treat every day. Patients come to us most often because Western Medicine is not very effective at treating IBS. Chinese Medicine seeks out what we consider to be the causes of the problem, and treats those. We do not treat the symptoms of this disease. \n Typical causes of IBS as detected by Chinese Medicine are: Heat or inflammation of the large or small intestines; emotional disturbances (either depression affecting the digestive system, or liver inflammation affecting the digestive system); or simply an overall weakness in the power of the digestive system, in which case patients often complain of fatigue, and usually speak with a soft voice. Traditional Chinese Medicine has a good track record in treating all of these causes. Recovery time is usually one month of treatment for every year you have had the problem. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Depression is one of the most common complaints we treat at One Essence Healing and Chinese Pulse Diagnosis can help us to determine the etiology of the depression, and Chinese Herbal Medicine, combined with Acupuncture, offers positive results. \n Conditions we treat include, but are not limited to: \n Treating smoking, drug, or alcohol addiction using Acupuncture has been well researched in the United States. The results show that the success rate is about the same as other methods, specifically about 50%. For this reason, in our office we combine both Acupuncture and Chinese herbs, which greatly increases the success rate. \n The role of Acupuncture in nicotine cessation isn’t limited to reducing cravings. Acupuncture has also been shown to promote relaxation and better sleep. Moreover, Acupuncture can be used to treat many disorders associated with smoking, such as damage to the bronchopulmonary and cardiovascular systems and the symptoms from nicotine withdrawal. In our experience, the effectiveness of Acupuncture to stop smoking varies with many factors, including the length of time the patient has been smoking, their overall health, and the frequency of treatment. In many cases, we will also use Auricular (ear) Acupuncture to help the patient retain the effects of Acupuncture between treatments. \n As of 2010, we have treated ADD in our clinic about 20 times. For those who went through the course of treatments, our success rate has been good. Success means no more drugs and a 80% reduction of symptoms. \n Treating this problem in children is extremely heartwarming. We have had several parents literally crying with joy because their children are behaving normally and are no longer on medication. In Chinese Medicine, the most common causes of this disease are either weakness of the lung, adrenal gland, and thyroid combined with slight anemia; or excessive heat/inflammation in the body causing enormous agitation. In either case, Chinese Medicine works very well and quickly too, especially with children. \n Depression and anxiety are two of the most common diseases we treat; usually seeing 20 or 30 patients a day. In Chinese Medicine there are at least 10 different causes of these conditions. First, we determine the etiology (causes) for the problem using Pulse Diagnosis. Once we are certain of the cause, the treatment follows automatically. For mild forms of depression and anxiety, our success rate is encouraging. For more severe problems such as bipolar disease or schizophrenia, Western Medicine appears to work better. \n The inability to sleep properly is one of the worst maladies that a patient can suffer. Insomnia makes everything worse — pain, anxiety, digestive disorders and a host of other problems. In Western Medicine, pharmaceutical drugs are the treatment of choice. The problem with these drugs, such as zolpidem (Ambien), eszopiclone (Lunesta), zaleplon (Sonata) or ramelteon (Rozerem), is that they can cause severe allergic reactions, facial swelling and unusual behaviors, such as driving or preparing and eating food while asleep. Side effects of prescription sleeping medications are often more pronounced in older people and may include excessive drowsiness, impaired thinking, night wandering, agitation and balance problems. \n In our clinic, we treat insomnia using Acupuncture and Chinese Herbs. In Chinese Medicine, insomnia is just a sign of lack of health and function. By restoring the patient to normal function the insomnia goes away. From our point of view, insomnia drugs do not restore a patient to normal function. They are largely used to subdue the symptom without any regard for the overall health of the individual. \n However, in fairness, Western Medicine is expanding its horizons and is now recommending improved diet and exercise as a way of treating insomnia. We applaud this approach, since it is much healthier than loading the patient up on drugs, especially if they are seniors. In Chinese Medicine, insomnia is usually a dysfunction in the heart or liver. If blood flow to the heart is slightly diminished the patient will have a hard time falling asleep. If the liver is inflamed or sluggish the patient will wake up a number of times at night. Both of these etiologies are treated very well using Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine. \n Childbirth is by far the largest strain on the human body for most women. The loss of blood and fluid at childbirth combined with sleep deprivation during the first year of the child’s life leaves most women tired, anxious and depressed. Western Medicine usually treats the problem with iron supplements if there is measurable anemia, counseling, and hormone replacement, along with anti-depressants or serotonin re-uptake drugs. \n Chinese Medicine takes a different approach. One of the gifts that Chinese Medicine gave the world is the knowledge and use of what are known as tonic herbs, such as ginseng, astragalus and many more. With this class of herbs a well-trained Chinese herbalist rebuilds the vitality and strength of a woman suffering from postpartum depression. The results are usually better than the Western approach and help restore the patient to their former level of vitality, prior to becoming pregnant. \n Stress and tension are very easily treated with either Acupuncture or Chinese Herbs. Even an inexperienced practitioner will be able to handle these two issues very well. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you. Together we implement lasting changes that will improve your energy, balance and health.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Here at One Essence Healing we treat a number of issues relating to women’s health. It’s our goal to help you feel better, and we’ll start with a relaxed consultation, a review of your medical history, pulse diagnosis, and a discussion of our findings and recommended treatments. \n Conditions we treat include, but are not limited to: \n Other than back pain, fatigue, anxiety and depression are the most common complaints that we treat in our clinic. In many cases, the fatigue is being caused by the excessive use of pharmaceuticals that the patient is taking, especially beta-blockers. With the permission and cooperation of the patient’s medical doctor, it is usually possible to reduce the number of drugs the patient is taking, especially those most responsible for the fatigue. \n In the State of Washington, an East Asian Medical Practitioner is not legally permitted to prescribe or adjust a patient’s medication. What we do find is that doctors are quite amenable when it comes to adjusting prescriptions. \n If the fatigue is not drug-related, then Chinese medicine is an excellent solution. Either the patient has too much toxicity in their system, or they are simply devoid of nutrients and low-level anemia is present. In either case, these problems can be improved using Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine. \n An analogy we often use is one of a garden hose which has no water coming out at the nozzle. Either the hose is pinched (too much toxicity), causing a reduction in water flow, or there simply is not enough water in the hose (weakness and anemia). Even though the complaint, fatigue, is the same for both problems, the methods of fixing the problems are completely different. \n Many women are suffering from this syndrome, which has no cure in Western Medicine. Clinically, we treat this problem at least five times a day with good results. \n In Chinese medicine, we find two etiologies (causes) for fibromyalgia. The first is very poor blood circulation, almost always due to obesity. For every extra 10 pounds we have on our frames, the diameter of our blood vessels are cut in half (Mayo Clinic). If the patient is overweight, then there is a systemic lack of nutrient (Ying) and oxygen (Qi) circulation to all the major muscle groups of the body and the sensory nerves which surround them. The result is constant chronic pain. \n Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine appear to be vasodilating the major longitudinal blood vessels of the body, thereby providing more oxygen and nutrients to the malnourished muscle groups. The result is a dramatic reduction of pain over a short period of time. \n The second etiology is also malnourishment, but from a different cause. Some fibromyalgia suffers are simply anemic or borderline anemic. The anemia is a plasma anemia which Western Medicine fails to acknowledge. This type of patient is thin, frail, has dry skin, does not sleep well, is usually anxious and jumpy, and of course has a lot of pain, especially in the upper body. Chinese Herbal Medicine seeks to restore the fluid deficiency in the blood and body. The result is an improvement in the condition known as fibromyalgia. \n Did you know that treating infertility with Acupuncture and TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) has been recorded in our ancient texts, and even on the backs of turtle shells, for thousands of years? How can this age-old medicine make such a difference? In the last five years the science behind many studies reveal that: \n The American Society of Reproductive Medicine’s Fertility \u0026 Sterility Journal has concluded the utility of acupuncture in conjunction with assisted reproductive technology. With all this evidence in the last five years, you would think that every reproductive clinic in the world would require their patients to receive acupuncture. Thanks to the role that acupuncture and TCM has played in helping women get pregnant, and the media coverage it has received in recent years, all of that is changing.\nMenopause \n Menopause is the permanent end of menstruation and fertility, defined as occuring 12 months after your last menstrual period. Menopause is a natural biological process, not a medical illness. Even so, the physical and emotional symptoms of menopause can disrupt your sleep, sap your energy and — at least indirectly — trigger feelings of sadness and loss.\nChinese medicine has been treating menopause for at least 2,000 years. The patient can expect the main symptoms of night sweats and hot flashes to be gone fairly quickly. The emotional upset that can go with menopause is treated very effectively with Chinese Herbal Medicine. In short, women suffering from menopause can expect an improvement in their symptoms using TCM. \n Among the most common complaints that we treat daily are menstrual disorders. Whether the problem is no period, too much bleeding, or excessive pain and cramping during menses, these are all problems readily handled by Chinese Herbal Medicine. Pain at period time is almost always due to vessel blockage in the lower abdomen. This can be caused by vaso-spasms in the vessels of the lower abdomen, excessive cold in the in the lower abdomen, fibroid cysts, or a disease known as endometriosis. All of these conditions, if not too structurally severe, are usually improved through a series of Acupuncture visits and the use of Chinese Herbal Medicine. \n Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) refers to a wide range of physical or emotional symptoms that typically occur about 5-11 days before a woman starts her monthly menstrual cycle. The symptoms usually start when menstruation begins, or shortly thereafter. In Chinese medicine, PMS is almost always attributable to poor blood flow through the liver at the time of menses. Encouraging better circulation through the hepatic artery, which delivers 70% of the blood to the liver, can be very effective in helping with these problems. The Chinese discovered almost 2,500 years ago that emotional upset, in most cases, is a result of poor circulation through the liver. Over the centuries, the Chinese developed several methods for increasing blood flow to and through this vital organ. Once the liver is functioning properly, the emotional ups and downs are greatly reduced. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you. Together we implement lasting changes that will improve your energy, balance and health.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Among the dermatological disorders treated at One Essence Healing are: \n It is common knowledge that skin diseases such as psoriasis, eczema, acne, and vitilego are not treated well with Western Medicine. Hives and Uticaria are treated well with drugs, but only symptomatically. In Western Medicine, the true cause of such disorders remains somewhat murky. Consequently, treatments are usually in the form of topical medicine, which is not adequate to remove the cause of the problem. There are pharmaceutically drugs which treat these diseases systemically, but there are many unwanted side effects, making treatment more difficult. \n Skin diseases or dermatological disorders are also difficult to treat with Traditional Chinese Medicine, but with one big difference. In TCM we have clear causes or etiologies for such diseases, and the treatment for them goes far beyond superficial topical ones. In treating psoriasis and eczema in our clinic, we expect a 40% improvement fairly quickly, with improvement beyond that level over time. There are no side effects of treatment and the patient will feel an overall improvement in health and vitality. Treatment consists of both Acupuncture and custom Chinese Herbal formulas. \n Skin diseases that respond well to Chinese Herbal Medicine are categorized as follows: \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

Asthma or Allergic Asthma is treated at least 10 times a day successfully in our clinic. We consider a successful outcome to be an 80% reduction of symptomology. \n Allergies are also treated well using Acupuncture and Chinese Herbs. Patients usually experience a noticeable improvement in the first two weeks. Unlike Western medications, Chinese Medicine is much more curative, actually boosting the patient’s immune strength while at the same time reducing symptoms. \n COPD or Emphysema can be more challenging. In all cases, we offer a free exam at our clinic to determine whether we can help the patient or not. In some cases we feel the problem is beyond our ability to help, but in those cases we can usually recommend a care provider. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Whether you turn to acupuncture or allopathic medicine for healing, choosing the right foods for your constitution will speed your progress. \n According to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), health is a state of balance in which food choice is key. As a longtime nutritionist I can report profound positive changes when people get their food selections right. \n Nutritional balance from a TCM perspective is far different from that of Western nutrition. Modern nutrition science is based on knowing the chemical composition of foods and the biochemical pathways of the body. Western nutritionists quantify nutrients such as protein, carbohydrates, and fat, then group foods accordingly, with a one-size-fits-all serving recommendation. \n The Food Pyramid, for example, groups bread, pasta, grains, and potatoes together as “carbohydrates” and suggests 5 to 8 servings. According to TCM, however, bread and pasta are damp and cooling, and thus are not recommended for someone overweight, bloated, or suffering sinus congestion. Sprouted grains, rye, and wild rice, although also carbohydrates, do not contribute to dampness because they have energetic properties different from flour and can actually be helpful for people with such yin conditions. \n According to Eastern traditions the forces of yin and yang are energetic qualities that shape everything in the universe, including our health. The Chinese symbol for yin is the shady side of a hill, while the symbol for yang is the sunny side. Thus yin qualities include coolness, dampness, and darkness, relative to the yang qualities of warmth, dryness, and light. Winter is yin, while summer is yang, and night is yin while day is yang. Arthritis made worse by cold weather is a yin condition. A red, inflamed rash brought on by heat is a yang condition. A ruddy-faced, irritable man with high blood pressure is relatively yang. An anemic, melancholy woman is relatively yin. \n Yin foods tend to be cooling and/or moistening for the body. Yang foods tend to be warming and drying. This has less to do with the actual temperature or moisture of the food and more to do with its “energetics.” Boiled spinach for example, is cooling and moistening, as is baked tofu. Chilled wine is warming, as is roast beef. Toast, while dry to touch, actually moistens the body. The effects of such food qualities on health have been observed for thousands of years. \n Your acupuncturist is trained to balance your body’s constitution. By observing your body and understanding the energetics of food, you can make food and activity choices to speed your body’s healing progress. Imbalance can come from an excess, or deficiency, of yin or yang. Although more complex than this, the following is an overview of yin and yang patterns of imbalance and the food choices that can help restore balance. Your constitution is ever changing, so be sure you adjust with the seasons and your life situation. \n A cold pattern often occurs in vegetarians or those who eat primarily raw foods, especially when they live in the cold. Cold can also set in with age and may be combined with dampness. Regular, warming aerobic exercise is essential. Healing food choices include warm lamb or beef dishes, dark poultry, meat-based soups and stews, free-range eggs, eel, trout, and wild salmon. Beneficial vegetables include cooked root veggies, baked winter squash, onions, and mustard greens. Nuts and seeds are warming, as are butter, cinnamon, garlic, ginger, turmeric, and pepper. Helpful grains include oatmeal, quinoa, and buckwheat. Food and drinks are best eaten cooked and warm. Salads, raw fruits, frozen desserts, pasta, white flour, and iced beverages should be minimized. \n Dampness can be associated with cold or heat and is exacerbated by damp living conditions. Chronic dampness is brought on by eating on the run, excessive worry, or from a diet rich in fried foods, breads, pasta, commercial dairy, ice cream, and other sweets. Too many salads and raw fruits weaken digestion and lead to dampness. Aerobic exercise is essential for balance. \n Helpful foods include lightly cooked greens including broccoli, turnip greens, asparagus, and kale. Fish and grilled or roasted meats and poultry are balancing. The best grains for a damp pattern are rye, jasmine, and basmati rice as well as sprouted grains. Radishes, turnips, pumpkin seeds, green tea, and bitter foods and herbs help to dry dampness. \n Sweets, dairy, and starchy foods contribute to dampness. Ice cream, lasagna, white bread, and milk should be avoided. \n A heat pattern often shows up in hot weather or with stress. Overwork, alcohol, and sugar heat the body. Meditation, walks in nature, swimming, and/or yoga are ideal for balancing the agitated nature of a heat imbalance. Ideal foods are salads, cucumbers, and lightly cooked green leafy vegetables especially spinach and watercress. Vegetables of all kinds are helpful whereas meats should be limited. \n Other cooling foods include melons, pears, bean dishes, mung beans, sprouts, sushi, non-spicy soups, and lots of water. Alcohol and sugar are best avoided. Mint is a beneficial cooling herb whereas pepper, garlic, ginger, and onions should be reduced. \n A dry pattern is a deficiency of yin, or fluids. Hormones, skin oils, saliva, digestive juices and secretions provide us our yin element. Fluids are akin to a car’s antifreeze; when low you can easily overheat or freeze. We see dryness at menopause, or as we age and skin becomes dry. Although hot flashes feel like heat, they are a sign of diminishing yin, which allows the normal heat of the body to go unchecked. Stress also depletes yin. \n Remedies include meditation, yoga, walks in nature and gardening. Beneficial fats are critical. Healthful choices include fatty fish, free-range eggs, grass-fed butter, goat and sheep cheeses, olive and coconut oil, dark poultry meat, pork, nuts, and avocado. Soups and stews rich with grass-fed animal fats are very helpful. Other moistening foods include black beans, green beans, Napa cabbage, winter squash, yams, sea vegetables, millet, whole wheat, fermented soy, and shellfish. \n Summer foods such as salads, cucumbers, and melons are ideal for hot weather. Conversely meats, root vegetables, hot soups, and stews are most nourishing in winter. Pay attention to your body and choose the foods that naturally seem balancing. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you. Together we implement lasting changes that will improve your energy, balance and health.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Dr. Fuhrman coined the word Nutritarian, but; at One Essence Healing it best describes the philosophy of a lifestyle we practice which concentrates on eating the most micronutrient rich foods. \n Simply put, a Nutritarian is a way of eating which bases food choices on maximizing the micronutrients per calorie. A Nutritarian lifestyle is designed with food that has powerful disease-protecting and therapeutic effects and delivers a broad array of micronutrients via a wide spectrum of food choices. It is not sufficient to merely avoid fats, consume foods with a low glycemic index, lower the intake of animal products, or eat a diet of mostly raw foods. A truly healthful Nutritarian lifestyle must be micronutrient rich and the micronutrient richness must be adjusted to meet individual needs. The foods with the highest micronutrient per calorie scores are green vegetables, colorful vegetables, and fresh fruits. For optimal health and to combat disease, it is necessary to consume enough of these foods that deliver the highest concentration of nutrients. \n  \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you. Together we implement lasting changes that will improve your energy, balance and health.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Raw and Living foods are uncooked, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, sprouted grains, sea vegetables, and fermented foods. These raw foods can be eaten whole or combined to make the healthiest, most delicious meals. \n Sound boring? That’s what we thought when we first heard about raw-live foods. Then we tasted the food.and were VERY surprised!!! What we didn’t know was that you could make all kinds of foods that are easy to make and are delicious. Recipes include things such as “burgers, pasta, pizza, veggie stir fry, cookies, and ice cream.” You just make things with healthy ingredients instead of processed ones and don’t cook at high temperatures so you don’t lose nutrients, enzymes and the vital life force of the food. \n Dr. McReynolds: I know this may sound like a commercial, but here are the main reasons: The food tastes great and is EASY to prepare. (Unless “cooking” is preparation is quick and easy, I don’t do it.) Other good news: my health has improved. I had been a vegetarian for many years, but it wasn’t until I transitioned to the raw-vegan lifestyle, that I don’t have that constant “run down” feeling. The biggest surprise for me was that the headaches I was having several times per weeks resolved. Also, my mental clarity and Spiritual walking have improved. I’d like to say that these changes did not take place overnight. They took several months, so don’t expect a quick fix. \n Dr. Weinthal: I’d like to give you a little background first. For me, food has always meant big family gatherings and cooking lots of “good food.” I don’t think I would have ever considered eating raw-live food if it hadn’t tasted so good. I still cook for large gatherings, but nowadays it is much more healthy. The food just tastes amazing and I feel great. A few years ago I needed 1-2 pots of coffee to make it through the day. I never thought I could have energy without drinking coffee. Would you believe that I don’t drink coffee anymore and have more energy that I could have ever imagined? Also, I used to have “digestion problems.” I’m very happy to say that these have also resolved. Like Dr. McReynolds, I have more mental clarity and better attunement. \n People report healing of: fibromyalgia, migraines, back pain, neck and joint pain, asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, hypoglycemia, colitis, diverticulitis, candida, arthritis, serious allergies, depression, anxiety, mood swings, heartburn, gas, bloating, constipation, skin diseases, obesity, chronic fatigue, obesity, cancers and many more. Most report increased energy and feeling just feeling better overall. \n Come to a raw/living food meetup to have fun, share live food, discuss raw lifestyle, and optimum wellness. Anyone interested in conscious eating for physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual brilliance is welcome. \n Come, let’s build a raw food community in Georgetown, Texas! \n Are you interested in meeting others who share your enthusiasm about achieving high energy health and vitality by incorporating whole, raw and living foods into their life?\nWould you like to learn new recipes, share stories, learn valuable health information and get support? \n Come to the Wellness Cafe to meet others interested in raw and living foods and health, get support, enjoy some raw tasty treats and a live speaker related to the raw foods lifestyle and health. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you. Together we implement lasting changes that will improve your energy, balance and health.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Superfoods are vibrant, nutritionally dense foods that have recently become widely available and which offer tremendous dietary and healing potential. There are many delicious and incredibly nutritious plant products such as goji berries, hemp seed, cacao beans (raw chocolate), maca, spirulina, bee products, and a host of others. As powerful sources of clean protein, vitamins, minerals, enzymes, antioxidants, good fats and oils, essential fatty and amino acids, and other nutrients, they represent a uniquely promising piece of the nutritional puzzle. \n Bee Pollen tastes slightly sweet (low glycemic), creamy with rich floral overtones. \n Bee Pollen uses include smoothies, salad dressings and eating by the handful. \n Bee Pollen with Hemp Seeds and Coconut are a natural match for Cacao (Chocolate) drinks. \n Bee Pollen supports maximum immune strength. There is little difference in local Bee Pollen as Histidine (amino acid) levels are what support immune function. \n Bee Pollen with Hemp Seeds and Cacao (Chocolate) rapidly balance women’s hormonal systems. \n Hemp Seeds are rich in protein (33%+), Omega 3/6 EFAs, GLA, Chlorophyll, and SDA (Stearidonic Acid) which increases EPA concentrations in eye/brain tissue. \n Hemp seeds taste slightly sweet (low glycemic), creamy with rich nutty, buttery and heavy cream flavors. \n Hemp seed uses include smoothies, salad dressings and eating by the handful. Hemp Seeds with Bee Pollen and Coconut are a natural match for Raw Cacao (Chocolate) drinks. \n Hemp seeds have an adaptive flavor. They can be used in both sweet or savory (non-sweet) recipes. Hemp seeds tend to amplify whatever flavors are present with them, especially sweeteners like Agave Nectar and pungent spices. \n Hemp fiber was used for clothes, sails and ropes of ships colonizing our world. The Declaration of Independence is written on Hemp paper. America was the world’s largest Hemp producer through the 1940′s until the paper, clothing and soybean lobbies joined forces to ban THC-free Hemp, to increase their profits. \n Your high-octane Super Food, Chocolate Drink additive. \n Uses: Rain Forest Rush was designed as an additive to Raw Super Food drinks and recipes, especially Chocolate drinks like Chocolate Bliss. It adds an entire new range of flavors and effects, specifically enhancing circulation, fluid exchange in brain/nerve tissue and rebooting peak cell function. \n Rain Forest Rush consists of: Guarana, Bee Pollen, Yerba Matte, Maca, Psyllium, Blue Green Algae, Grasses (Barley, Wheat, Alfalfa, Dandelion, Oat) and Sun Fire Salt. \n Tocotrienols are a cold processed, enzymatically stabilized, whole rice bran rich in Vitamin E oils with 100-1000 times more antioxidant potential than Vitamin E related tocopherols. \n This unique mix of proteins, oils, antioxidants and fiber greatly enhances Vitamin A metabolism. Tocos are a powerful synergist with Camu Camu and MSM for cell/tissue/skin integrity and with Cacao Butter for rapid remyelination of neural sheathing. \n Adds a great malt flavor to recipes, and combines equally well in Cacao drinks, dessert recipes and savory dishes. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you. Together we implement lasting changes that will improve your energy, balance and health.

Furthermore, I’ve immediately started going to the church building daily at 5:00 am to practice for an hour before work.On Campus Students\n\n\tMusic Majors\n\t\n\t\tDegree Programs\n\t\tCareer and Income Opportunities\n\t\tAdmissions and Scholarship\n\t\tStudents\n\t\n\n\tNon-Music Majors\n\t\n\t\tGroup Organ Study\n\t\tPrivate Organ Study\n\t\tOrgan Registration\n\t\n\n\n \n Music Majors\n\t\n\t\tDegree Programs\n\t\tCareer and Income Opportunities\n\t\tAdmissions and Scholarship\n\t\tStudents\n\t\n \n Degree Programs \n Career and Income Opportunities \n Admissions and Scholarship \n Students \n Non-Music Majors\n\t\n\t\tGroup Organ Study\n\t\tPrivate Organ Study\n\t\tOrgan Registration\n\t\n \n Group Organ Study \n Private Organ Study \n Organ Registration \n Off Campus Students\n\n\tFinding An Organ Teacher\n\tBYU Programs for Off-Campus Organists (Organ Certification)\n\t\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 1-2\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 3-6\n\t\tRepertoire for BYU Independent Study Organ Courses\n\t\n\n\tContinuing Your Organ Training PDF\n\tMaterials Needed For Independent Study Organ Classes PDF\n\tBYU Organ Workshop\n\tOrganTutor\n\tMentor Instructions\n\n \n Finding An Organ Teacher \n BYU Programs for Off-Campus Organists (Organ Certification)\n\t\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 1-2\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 3-6\n\t\tRepertoire for BYU Independent Study Organ Courses\n\t\n \n Independent Study Organ Levels 1-2 \n Independent Study Organ Levels 3-6 \n Repertoire for BYU Independent Study Organ Courses \n Continuing Your Organ Training PDF \n Materials Needed For Independent Study Organ Classes PDF \n BYU Organ Workshop \n OrganTutor \n Mentor Instructions \n Events\n\n\tBYU Organ Workshop\n\tPipe Organ Study Tour of Germany\n\tAGO Events\n\t\n\t\tUtah Valley Chapter AGO\n\t\tSalt Lake City Chapter AGO\n\t\n\n\n \n BYU Organ Workshop \n Pipe Organ Study Tour of Germany \n AGO Events\n\t\n\t\tUtah Valley Chapter AGO\n\t\tSalt Lake City Chapter AGO\n\t\n \n Utah Valley Chapter AGO \n Salt Lake City Chapter AGO \n Ward Organists\n\n\tThe New Ward Organist\n\tWard Organist Training\n\t\n\t\tOrgan Training Outlines\n\t\n\n\tTraveling Organ Workshops\n\tOrgan Training Resources PDF\n\tU of U Group Organ Instruction\n\tUsing OrganTutor PDF\n\tFree Accompaniment PDF\n\n \n The New Ward Organist \n Ward Organist Training\n\t\n\t\tOrgan Training Outlines\n\t\n \n Organ Training Outlines \n Traveling Organ Workshops \n Organ Training Resources PDF \n U of U Group Organ Instruction \n Using OrganTutor PDF \n Free Accompaniment PDF \n Workshops\n\n\tOnline Training Sessions\n\t2021 BYU Organ Workshop\n\tTraveling Organ Workshops\n\n \n Online Training Sessions \n 2021 BYU Organ Workshop \n Traveling Organ Workshops \n Info \u0026 Reference\n\n\tOrgan Training Resources PDF\n\tCarol Dean\n\tContinuing Your Organ Training\n\tDouglas E.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n I came to Dr. Weinthal a little over two months ago, seeking an alternative to undergoing an epidural steroid injection to treat pain, numbness, and tingling in my shoulder, neck, and arm, caused by arthritic bone spurs pushing on nerves.   I wanted not only relief from pain, but education on how I could do things to minimize my discomfort.  I got BOTH! \n Dr. Weinthal not only used acupuncture and Chinese herbs to help me, but also he educated me about proper intake of vitamins and minerals and the use of various exercises.  I am happy to report that after only a couple weeks' treatment and application of exercise and better nutrition, I was able to stop taking ibuprofen and other painkillers completely.  Even better, I have been able to resume my normal activities of walking, swimming, playing with grandchildren, cooking, and cleaning, when at one point before treatment I could hardly cut my own food with a fork!  I am very grateful to Dr. Weinthal for his caring treatment! \n Dr. Weinthal, \n We are very thankful for you! Though we came to treat kip, you have also positively influenced our family's health and nutrition. I appreciate your willingness to share your knowledge. At times you have been a confirmation and a motivator to explore healthier habits and options. Crossing paths with you has been an important milestone in our family's journey to exceptional everyday life and health. \n Thanks! We'll see ya soon! \n   \n   \n I suffered with chronic shoulder  pain for 10 years, a MRI diagnosed me with bursitis and a possible tear of the rotator cuff. Also recovering from a broken ankle and carpal tunnel in both hands, I was in great need of a miracle.  My son met Dr. Weinthal in his Health Science Technology class at school, where he came and spoke to the class about acupuncture and natural healing.   Two days before surgery, I decided to see Dr. Weinthal, who treated all the above areas and also prescribed herbs.   Today, I am pain free and able do the things I enjoy. \n Thanks to Dr. Weinthal and his acupuncture treatments, I have a better quality of life. \n Also for encouraging my son and his classmates to persue their dreams. \n I was suffering with food allergies including a gluten intolerance, anxiety and other sensitivities and had been told that I would have to abstain from eating certain foods for the rest of my life. Then I found out about a treatment called NAET. After seeing one practitioner who I was not completely satisfied with I found Dr. Weinthal. To me, Dr. Weinthal is unlike many doctors in that he took the time to first talk with me over the phone about my symptoms, answer my questions, explain how allergies work, etc. And then when I saw him what struck me was how compassionate and sensitive to my needs he was. Not only is he a Doctor of Oriental Medicine/acupuncturist but he listens like a guidance counselor would as well! He really wants to help you. I have done many treatments with Dr. Weinthal and over the period of treatments I could feel that my immune system was overall improving. I was less sensitive to smells, my hair was not falling out anymore, and most significantly I could eat gluten again! I continue to see Dr. Weinthal when I need a health booster and tell all my friends who have allergies about him! \n I’ve suffered from allergies, headaches, and chronic sinusitis for years; surgery, allergy shots, and prescription medication had not stopped the cycle of chronic infection. \n When I came to see Dr. Weinthal I had an acute sinus infection, and had developed allergies to several antibiotics. I couldn't start my day without a large dose of ibuprofen, nasal spray, decongestant, saline rinses, and even then I was dragging and spending hours napping. \n I was thrilled when I got noticeable relief from my congestion and pain with the first acupuncture treatment. Since seeing Dr. Weinthal for acupuncture and NAET, my sinus problems have diminished, I have had MUCH more energy, and I rarely reach for ibuprofen or anything else. My previous medical beliefs based on Western models have been turned topsy-turvy, but I’m delighted. \n After experiencing chronic pain for several months, I made an appointment with Dr. Weinthal for acupuncture treatments. When I began treatment my pain level was so intense that I could no longer lead a normal life. Nothing, including prescription pain medications, had alleviated my pain. Dr. Weinthal's calming presence helped ease my nervousness about acupuncture. He took the time to explain the treatment process and thoroughly answered my questions. My pain began to lessen after my first treatment and after several weeks of acupuncture I was pain free. Acupuncture has allowed me to regain my life. \n Dr. Weinthal definitely has an authentic gift for healing. Not only is he knowledgeable and skilled in Eastern medicine, but he is deeply intuitive and empathetic regarding the needs of his clients.\nWhen I came to to Dr. Weinthal I was in crisis, not only physically, but on each level of my Being. I was hormonally imbalanced, exhausted, and suffering from frequent migraine headaches and nausea. My emotional self was vulnerable and tentative; mentally I was often unclear and scattered; and, my spiritual self was malnourished. \n As a result of Dr. Weinthal's comprehensive attention to the needs of my Whole Being I feel like my potential has been awakened. My energy level and zest for life are steadily increasing. Hormonally I am becoming regulated and balanced. Additionally, my symptoms of headache and nausea are becoming less frequent and intense. I feel more grounded and stable emotionally. And, mentally, I am clearer and more focused. Spiritually I feel more nourished and open to receive. Overall, through his unique healing approach, Dr. Weinthal has facilitated the activation of my own natural healing resources. I am deeply appreciative and grateful for Dr. Weinthal and his authentic, heart-centered, healing work. \n I had tension headaches and migraines every day for the past 17 years. I saw Dr. Weinthal and had only 2 slight headaches between treatments. Dr. Weinthal also prescribed herbs for me that I take everyday. I go weeks if not longer without headaches. If I stop taking the herbs or miss my treatments, the pain comes back and I can't work some days. \n I have also had panic attacks for the past year. I used to wake up with heart palpitations and vomiting. Dr. Weinthal also prescibed another herb for me that has made a world of difference. He has also worked with me on spiritual healing that has helped bring balance to my work and personal life. \n Dr. Weinthal definitely has an authentic gift for healing. Not only is he knowledgeable and skilled in Eastern medicine, but he is deeply intuitive and empathetic regarding the needs of his clients. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you. Together we implement lasting changes that will improve your energy, balance and health.

Like calmness and strength, these outward features are universally attractive. While we work towards these qualities with regimens that may include exercise, meditation, or even using a nice shampoo, the foods we eat are key to achieving inner and outer beauty. \n In traditional Chinese medicine, foods are prescribed for their effects on organs, blood, yin, yang, and Qi, the major players in our physical and emotional health. Foods such as rice, seaweed, sweet potatoes, and bananas nourish our yin, which in turn hydrates and nourishes organs. Think of a parched plant; after a good watering it becomes more tumescent. Eating yin-enhancing foods nourishes the body in a way that simple drinking water cannot. \n Sweet black rice, when cooked with longan berries (euphoria longana) and Chinese dates, becomes a congee that nourishes blood and Qi.

Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat and simmer for two hours, stirring occasionally. Garnish with ginger. Makes four servings.\nNote: All ingredients are available at most Asian grocery stores. \n  \n Adding nutrient-rich super foods to the diet can give men a healthy boost. \n Here are just a few foods that can help maintain muscle mass, prevent prostate cancer, and more. \n Avocados\nAvocados are a good source of vitamin K, dietary fiber, vitamin B6, vitamin C, folate and copper.  Rich in potassium, avocados contain more of this nutrient than bananas.  Potassium is needed to regulate nerves, heartbeat and, especially, blood pressure.  An added bonus for men: Avocados inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells. \n Blackberries\nBlackberries are packed with Vitamin C, calcium and magnesium, with more than double the amounts than their popular cousin, the blueberry.  Vitamin C is a powerful stress reducer that can lower blood pressure and return cortisol levels to normal faster when taken during periods of stress.  Magnesium and calcium act together to help regulate the nerves and muscle tone. \n Too little magnesium in your diet can cause nerve cells to become over activated and can trigger muscular tension, soreness, spasms, cramps, and fatigue.  Blackberries also score high on the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) scale assesses the antioxidant content of food: the higher the score, the better the food’s ability to neutralize cell-damaging free radicals that lead to cancer. \n Spinach\nSpinach is one of the most nutrient-dense foods in existence.  Spinach can help protect against prostate cancer, reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke, lower blood pressure and strengthen muscles. \n Walnuts\nWhen it comes to their health benefits, walnuts are the king of nuts. Richer in heart-healthy omega-3s than salmon, loaded with more anti-oxidants than red wine, and packing half as much muscle-building protein as chicken, walnuts are one of the all time super foods. \n Yogurt\nEating yogurt that contains live bacterial cultures every day improves digestive health, boosts the immune system, provides protection against cancer and may help you live longer.   Not all yogurts are probiotic though, so make sure the label says “live and active cultures.” \n Let us custom-tailor a treatment plan that will best suit your individual needs so that you can feel better quickly and safely! \n  \n Acupuncture views nutrition in a complex light, through the application of Oriental medicine wisdom to dietary habits. In short, certain foods are considered too yang, or hot to eat in excess during the warmer months, while others are prized for their yin ability to cool the body. Overall, the goal is balance between the internal yin and yang of the body. \n A healthy, nutritional diet, good sleep and moderate exercise can keep your skin and physical form at its best. \n For healthy skin, be sure to integrate these foods into your diet: \n Carrots and Sweet Potatoes: \n Healthy skin is directly dependent on the amount of vitamin A in our diet. Vitamin A acts as an antioxidant to neutralize harmful elements in our skin, helping to prevent wrinkles, resist infection and maintain the skin’s elasticity. Some of the best sources of Vitamin A are vegetables that are deep orange in color. \n Blackberries, Blueberries, Strawberries, and Plums:  \n In a study recently published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, these four fruits weighed in with the highest “total antioxidant capacity” of any food.  The antioxidants and other phytochemicals in these fruits can protect cells from damage and disintegration, thus guarding against premature aging. \n Salmon, Walnuts, Olive Oil, and Flax Seed:  \n Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are responsible for skin repair, moisture content, and overall elasticity, but because the body cannot produce its own EFAs, they must be obtained through the diet. Fish, walnuts, and flax seed oil are among the best sources for omega 3 fatty acids. Eating good-quality olive oil helps keep skin lubricated and keeps it looking and feeling healthier overall. Which olive oils are the best for your skin? Those labeled “cold pressed,” “expeller processed,” or “extra virgin” are the least processed forms. As a result, they contain the highest levels of antioxidant substances. \n Whole Wheat Bread, Brown Rice, Turkey, Tuna and Brazil Nuts:  \n Selenium is an antioxidant mineral responsible for tissue elasticity and healthy skin. It may also play an important role in preventing skin cancer, as some recent studies are showing that skin damaged by the sun may suffer fewer consequences if selenium levels are high. \n Green Tea:  \n Green tea’s ability to slow down the development of some signs of aging is attributed to its high levels of polyphenols, which have been well-documented for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Green tea may help prevent or reduce the risk of skin cancer according to a study published recently in the Archives of Dermatology, which shows that whether taken orally or applied to the skin, green tea can reduce the risk of damage from ultraviolet light and thus reduce the risk of skin cancer. \n Water : \n  Hydration plays a key role in keeping skin cells healthy. It is essential to maintaining your skin’s elasticity and suppleness. Keeping cells hydrated helps cells move nutrients in and toxins out, which helps keep skin clean and clear. \n Let us help you to optimize your skin health! \n Acupuncture and Oriental medicine can be very effective at treating skin conditions. Treatments can provide quick relief for acute symptoms and significant and lasting relief from recurrent or chronic skin conditions. \n The skin reflects and reacts to imbalances within the body’s internal landscape and the effects of the environment. Internal disharmonies caused by strong emotions, diet, and your constitution, as well as environmental influences such as wind, dryness, dampness, and heat, can all contribute to the development of a skin disorder. To keep your skin healthy and beautiful on the outside, you must work on the inside of your body as well. Increasing the flow of energy, blood and lymph circulation improves the skin’s natural healthy color. \n Promotion of collagen production increases muscle tone and elasticity, helping to firm the skin. Stimulating the formation of body fluids nourishes the skin and encourages it to be moister, softer, smoother and more lustrous. \n General skin conditions that can be treated with acupuncture and Oriental medicine include acne, dermatitis, eczema, pruritus, psoriasis, rosacea, shingles and urticaria (hives). Oriental medicine does not recognize skin problems as one particular syndrome. Instead, it aims to treat the specific symptoms that are unique to each individual using a variety of techniques with acupuncture, such as herbal medicine, bodywork, lifestyle/dietary recommendations and energetic exercises to restore imbalances found in the body. Therefore, if 10 patients are treated with Oriental medicine for eczema, each patient will receive a unique, customized treatment with different lifestyle and dietary recommendations. \n If you suffer from a skin condition or would like to know how to optimize your skin health, Contact One Essence Healing to learn more about how acupuncture and Oriental medicine can help you. \n More than 95 million Americans suffer from digestive disorders ranging from constipation, diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome to more serious conditions such as acid reflux (GERD), ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. In fact, more than 35 million physician office visits a year are due to gastrointestinal complaints. Reports are confirming that acupuncture and Oriental medicine can offer relief from even the most complex digestive problems. \n Evidence that Oriental medicine has been used for digestive disorders can be found in early medical literature dating back to 3 AD, where specific acupuncture points and herbal formulas for borborygmus (rumbling or gurgling in the intestines), abdominal pain and diarrhea with pain are discussed. \n According to Oriental medical theory, most digestive disorders are due to disharmony in the spleen and stomach. The spleen plays a central part in the health and vitality of the body, taking a lead role in the assimilation of nutrients and maintenance of physical strength. It turns digested food from the stomach into usable nutrients and qi (energy). Many schools of thought have been formed around this organ; the premise being that the proper functioning of the”‘middle” is the key to all aspects of vitality. \n By taking into account a person’s constitution and varied symptoms, a treatment plan is designed specifically for the individual to bring their “middle” back into harmony and optimize the proper functioning of the digestive system. A variety of techniques can be used during treatment including acupuncture, lifestyle/dietary recommendations and energetic exercises to restore digestive health. \n Is your digestive system functioning as well as it could? Acupuncture and Oriental medicine are extremely effective at treating a wide array of digestive disorders. Contact us today to learn more about how acupuncture and Oriental medicine can be integrated into your digestive wellness plan! \n Repetitive stress injuries (RSI) are the most common job-related injuries and are responsible for the highest number of days lost among all work related injuries. One of the most well-known types of repetitive stress injury, carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) accounts for over two million visits to physicians’ offices and approximately 465,000 carpal tunnel release operations each year, making it the most frequent surgery of the hand and wrist. \n Symptoms of repetitive stress injuries include tightness, stiffness, pain, tingling, numbness, coldness and loss of strength in the arm. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a repetitive stress injury that refers specifically to the inflammation of a specific ligament that puts pressure on the median nerve. \n Acupuncture is extremely effective for treating repetitive stress injuries including carpal tunnel syndrome; eliminating the need for surgery or the use of anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids. In fact, one of the most common reasons that people get acupuncture is for repetitive stress injuries. Recent studies even suggest that acupuncture may be more effective than corticosteroids when it comes to treating CTS. \n The carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway in the wrist made up of ligaments and bones. The median nerve and the tendons that connect the fingers to the muscles of the forearm pass through this tightly spaced tunnel. \n Carpal tunnel syndrome, also known as median nerve entrapment, occurs when swelling or irritation of the tendons in the carpal tunnel results in pressure on the median nerve causing pain in the palm side of the wrist and pain and tingling in the fingers. The median nerve controls sensations to the palm side of the thumb and fingers, as well as impulses to some small muscles in the hand that allow the fingers and thumb to move. \n Symptoms usually start gradually, with frequent burning, tingling, or numbness in the palm of the hand and the fingers, especially the index, middle and ring fingers. Pain can sometimes travel up the arm and affect the shoulder. The symptoms often first appear during the night. As symptoms worsen, people might feel pain, weakness, or numbness in the hand and wrist, radiating up the arm during the day. Decreased grip strength may make it difficult to form a fist, grasp small objects, or perform other manual tasks. If not properly treated, CTS can cause irreversible nerve damage and permanent deterioration of muscle tissue. \n From an Oriental medicine perspective, a repetitive stress injury is seen as a disruption of the flow of Qi and Blood (Xue) within the area and associated with cold, dampness or wind penetrating the muscles and sinews. Acupuncture points, stretching exercises, herbal remedies and nutritional supplements are chosen to treat accordingly. \n In addition to reducing the swelling, inflammation and pain, acupuncture addresses any headaches, neck pain, shoulder stiffness and sleeping problems that often accompany this condition. Your treatment may also take into account any underlying conditions that contribute to the development of RSI including posture, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid problems, diabetes, and hormonal changes of pregnancy and menopause. \n Managing repetitive stress injuries often requires some lifestyle changes, and it can take time to work out a strategy that works best for you. \n Here are a few minor changes you can implement to minimize stress on your hands and wrists: \n Shoulders and neck should be relaxed to open the chest and allow your head to float upwards without strain. When using a keyboard, wrists should be in a relaxed middle position and in a straight line with your forearms at elbow height or slightly lower.\nIf you or someone you know suffers from a repetitive stress injury, Call us today to learn more about how acupuncture and Oriental medicine can help you. \n Our society puts a premium on our waking hours and has the tendency to underestimate the importance of a full-night’s sleep. Often, good sleep hygiene is an afterthought for many people. Millions of people are besieged with insomnia and look for quick fixes instead of exploring the root causes of the problem. \n Evening is a time to allow our minds and bodies to turn inward to our subconscious. Excessive lighting at night, evening shift work, evening computing, video games, television and late-night eating all serve to counteract the body’s natural rhythms. It’s no wonder people have trouble sleeping. Exposure to early morning light and dusk helps to regulate sleep hormones in the body. Rather than embrace nighttime we tend to let our minds wander from one element of stress to another keeping us up for hours or perhaps an entire evening. We are then forced to approach the new day without having benefited from the regenerative powers that night time brings. \n In Oriental medicine sleep occurs when the yang energy of the day folds into Yin – nighttime. Yin energy of the body is cooling and restorative. It is the time of day when our bodies turn inward and regenerate. This is the time we dream and explore the caverns of our unconscious mind. Conversely, daytime is yang, which is expansive. We expend the energy we have built up from the process of sleeping. Together, this is the cycle of yin and yang. \n To apply the concept of yin and yang to your everyday life try eating your last meal at least three hours before going to bed. If you are a hot excess type, you can cool your body down by avoiding hot and spicy food and drink. Avoid alcohol, coffee, chocolate any other stimulants, especially late in the day. \n Help circulate your body’s energy by working out or by gentle exercising. Build your body’s nutritive aspect by eating marrow based soups and stews, dark pigmented vegetables and fruits. Avoid overworking or over rumination as well. \n Meditation is an invaluable tool to help your brain unwind. Helping the body create a sense of calm meditation can reduce stress, increase feelings of well-being, and improve overall health. It is of specific use to help one increase alertness, relaxation and reflection even in “waking” states. Meditation is best practiced during the day to help ease your sleep patterns at night. \n One contributor to insomnia, stress, weakens the function of the liver, which in turn affects the health of your nerves. Acupuncture and Oriental medicine have a calming effect on the nervous system clearing obstructions in the muscle and nerve channels, assisting the flow of oxygen-enriched energy and relaxing the system. Common noted benefits include deeper breathing, improved digestive abilities, better sleeping patterns, and a general sense of well being. \n Practicing good sleep hygiene and keeping your body in sync with the rhythm of day and night can help your body cope with sleep deprivation give it an opportunity to get stronger and heal. \n By implementing just a few of the following suggestions you should notice a great improvement in your sleep and how you function in the daylight hours. \n   \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you. Together we implement lasting changes that will improve your energy, balance and health.

From a Western perspective, we know that longans contain large amounts of Vitamin C and phenolic compounds, which may help to detoxify and protect the liver. \n Alternate Tasks – Avoid doing the same task for more than a couple of hours at a time and alternate between tasks that use different muscle groups where possible. Fatigue is a sign that you need to take a break. Take small breaks to gently stretch and bend your hands and wrists and readjust your position. \n Reduce Pressure – Many people use more force than needed to perform tasks involving their hands, which can increase pressure and cause irritation. Be mindful of the speed and amount of pressure used to perform tasks. Ease up, slow down, and grip using your palm or whole hand to distribute the load. If using tools such as riveters or jackhammers for extended periods, take frequent breaks or operate the tool at a speed that causes the least amount of vibration. \n Cultivate Good Posture – Incorrect posture can cause your shoulders to roll forward, shortening neck and shoulder muscles and compressing nerves in your neck, which can affect your wrists, hands, and fingers. \n Maintain a routine sleep schedule. \n Make your bedroom a sanctuary. \n Keep it dark, cool, and quiet. \n Establish a sense of safety with your surroundings. \n Reduce nicotine, caffeine and alcohol use. \n Avoid rigorous exercise 3-5 hours prior to bedtime. \n Avoid heavy meals near bedtime. \n Position clock away from the bed. \n Limit television and computer use to early evening.",

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n For most cultures across the globe, there are beauty constants such as clear skin, bright eyes, and shiny hair. Like calmness and strength, these outward features are universally attractive. While we work towards these qualities with regimens that may include exercise, meditation, or even using a nice shampoo, the foods we eat are key to achieving inner and outer beauty. \n In traditional Chinese medicine, foods are prescribed for their effects on organs, blood, yin, yang, and Qi, the major players in our physical and emotional health. Foods such as rice, seaweed, sweet potatoes, and bananas nourish our yin, which in turn hydrates and nourishes organs. Think of a parched plant; after a good watering it becomes more tumescent. Eating yin-enhancing foods nourishes the body in a way that simple drinking water cannot. \n Sweet black rice, when cooked with longan berries (euphoria longana) and Chinese dates, becomes a congee that nourishes blood and Qi. In the Chinese system of food cures, these three foods work together to enhance beauty and longevity. \n Sweet Rice Congee (Taken from Ancient Healing for Modern Women, by Dr. Xiolan Zhao, C.M.D.) \n Ingredients: \n   \n Instructions: \n In a large heavy saucepan, add 6 cups of water, black sweet rice, longan fruit, dates, and raw sugar. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat and simmer for two hours, stirring occasionally. Garnish with ginger. Makes four servings.\nNote: All ingredients are available at most Asian grocery stores. \n  \n Adding nutrient-rich super foods to the diet can give men a healthy boost. \n Here are just a few foods that can help maintain muscle mass, prevent prostate cancer, and more. \n Avocados\nAvocados are a good source of vitamin K, dietary fiber, vitamin B6, vitamin C, folate and copper.  Rich in potassium, avocados contain more of this nutrient than bananas.  Potassium is needed to regulate nerves, heartbeat and, especially, blood pressure.  An added bonus for men: Avocados inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells. \n Blackberries\nBlackberries are packed with Vitamin C, calcium and magnesium, with more than double the amounts than their popular cousin, the blueberry.  Vitamin C is a powerful stress reducer that can lower blood pressure and return cortisol levels to normal faster when taken during periods of stress.  Magnesium and calcium act together to help regulate the nerves and muscle tone. \n Too little magnesium in your diet can cause nerve cells to become over activated and can trigger muscular tension, soreness, spasms, cramps, and fatigue.  Blackberries also score high on the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) scale assesses the antioxidant content of food: the higher the score, the better the food’s ability to neutralize cell-damaging free radicals that lead to cancer. \n Spinach\nSpinach is one of the most nutrient-dense foods in existence.  Spinach can help protect against prostate cancer, reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke, lower blood pressure and strengthen muscles. \n Walnuts\nWhen it comes to their health benefits, walnuts are the king of nuts. Richer in heart-healthy omega-3s than salmon, loaded with more anti-oxidants than red wine, and packing half as much muscle-building protein as chicken, walnuts are one of the all time super foods. \n Yogurt\nEating yogurt that contains live bacterial cultures every day improves digestive health, boosts the immune system, provides protection against cancer and may help you live longer.   Not all yogurts are probiotic though, so make sure the label says “live and active cultures.” \n Let us custom-tailor a treatment plan that will best suit your individual needs so that you can feel better quickly and safely! \n  \n Acupuncture views nutrition in a complex light, through the application of Oriental medicine wisdom to dietary habits. In short, certain foods are considered too yang, or hot to eat in excess during the warmer months, while others are prized for their yin ability to cool the body. Overall, the goal is balance between the internal yin and yang of the body. \n A healthy, nutritional diet, good sleep and moderate exercise can keep your skin and physical form at its best. \n For healthy skin, be sure to integrate these foods into your diet: \n Carrots and Sweet Potatoes: \n Healthy skin is directly dependent on the amount of vitamin A in our diet. Vitamin A acts as an antioxidant to neutralize harmful elements in our skin, helping to prevent wrinkles, resist infection and maintain the skin’s elasticity. Some of the best sources of Vitamin A are vegetables that are deep orange in color. \n Blackberries, Blueberries, Strawberries, and Plums:  \n In a study recently published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, these four fruits weighed in with the highest “total antioxidant capacity” of any food.  The antioxidants and other phytochemicals in these fruits can protect cells from damage and disintegration, thus guarding against premature aging. \n Salmon, Walnuts, Olive Oil, and Flax Seed:  \n Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are responsible for skin repair, moisture content, and overall elasticity, but because the body cannot produce its own EFAs, they must be obtained through the diet. Fish, walnuts, and flax seed oil are among the best sources for omega 3 fatty acids. Eating good-quality olive oil helps keep skin lubricated and keeps it looking and feeling healthier overall. Which olive oils are the best for your skin? Those labeled “cold pressed,” “expeller processed,” or “extra virgin” are the least processed forms. As a result, they contain the highest levels of antioxidant substances. \n Whole Wheat Bread, Brown Rice, Turkey, Tuna and Brazil Nuts:  \n Selenium is an antioxidant mineral responsible for tissue elasticity and healthy skin. It may also play an important role in preventing skin cancer, as some recent studies are showing that skin damaged by the sun may suffer fewer consequences if selenium levels are high. \n Green Tea:  \n Green tea’s ability to slow down the development of some signs of aging is attributed to its high levels of polyphenols, which have been well-documented for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Green tea may help prevent or reduce the risk of skin cancer according to a study published recently in the Archives of Dermatology, which shows that whether taken orally or applied to the skin, green tea can reduce the risk of damage from ultraviolet light and thus reduce the risk of skin cancer. \n Water : \n  Hydration plays a key role in keeping skin cells healthy. It is essential to maintaining your skin’s elasticity and suppleness. Keeping cells hydrated helps cells move nutrients in and toxins out, which helps keep skin clean and clear. \n Let us help you to optimize your skin health! \n Acupuncture and Oriental medicine can be very effective at treating skin conditions. Treatments can provide quick relief for acute symptoms and significant and lasting relief from recurrent or chronic skin conditions. \n The skin reflects and reacts to imbalances within the body’s internal landscape and the effects of the environment. Internal disharmonies caused by strong emotions, diet, and your constitution, as well as environmental influences such as wind, dryness, dampness, and heat, can all contribute to the development of a skin disorder. To keep your skin healthy and beautiful on the outside, you must work on the inside of your body as well. Increasing the flow of energy, blood and lymph circulation improves the skin’s natural healthy color. \n Promotion of collagen production increases muscle tone and elasticity, helping to firm the skin. Stimulating the formation of body fluids nourishes the skin and encourages it to be moister, softer, smoother and more lustrous. \n General skin conditions that can be treated with acupuncture and Oriental medicine include acne, dermatitis, eczema, pruritus, psoriasis, rosacea, shingles and urticaria (hives). Oriental medicine does not recognize skin problems as one particular syndrome. Instead, it aims to treat the specific symptoms that are unique to each individual using a variety of techniques with acupuncture, such as herbal medicine, bodywork, lifestyle/dietary recommendations and energetic exercises to restore imbalances found in the body. Therefore, if 10 patients are treated with Oriental medicine for eczema, each patient will receive a unique, customized treatment with different lifestyle and dietary recommendations. \n If you suffer from a skin condition or would like to know how to optimize your skin health, Contact One Essence Healing to learn more about how acupuncture and Oriental medicine can help you. \n More than 95 million Americans suffer from digestive disorders ranging from constipation, diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome to more serious conditions such as acid reflux (GERD), ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. In fact, more than 35 million physician office visits a year are due to gastrointestinal complaints.

The spleen plays a central part in the health and vitality of the body, taking a lead role in the assimilation of nutrients and maintenance of physical strength. It turns digested food from the stomach into usable nutrients and qi (energy). Many schools of thought have been formed around this organ; the premise being that the proper functioning of the”‘middle” is the key to all aspects of vitality. \n By taking into account a person’s constitution and varied symptoms, a treatment plan is designed specifically for the individual to bring their “middle” back into harmony and optimize the proper functioning of the digestive system. A variety of techniques can be used during treatment including acupuncture, lifestyle/dietary recommendations and energetic exercises to restore digestive health. \n Is your digestive system functioning as well as it could? Acupuncture and Oriental medicine are extremely effective at treating a wide array of digestive disorders. Contact us today to learn more about how acupuncture and Oriental medicine can be integrated into your digestive wellness plan! \n Repetitive stress injuries (RSI) are the most common job-related injuries and are responsible for the highest number of days lost among all work related injuries. One of the most well-known types of repetitive stress injury, carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) accounts for over two million visits to physicians’ offices and approximately 465,000 carpal tunnel release operations each year, making it the most frequent surgery of the hand and wrist. \n Symptoms of repetitive stress injuries include tightness, stiffness, pain, tingling, numbness, coldness and loss of strength in the arm. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a repetitive stress injury that refers specifically to the inflammation of a specific ligament that puts pressure on the median nerve. \n Acupuncture is extremely effective for treating repetitive stress injuries including carpal tunnel syndrome; eliminating the need for surgery or the use of anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids. In fact, one of the most common reasons that people get acupuncture is for repetitive stress injuries. Recent studies even suggest that acupuncture may be more effective than corticosteroids when it comes to treating CTS. \n The carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway in the wrist made up of ligaments and bones. The median nerve and the tendons that connect the fingers to the muscles of the forearm pass through this tightly spaced tunnel. \n Carpal tunnel syndrome, also known as median nerve entrapment, occurs when swelling or irritation of the tendons in the carpal tunnel results in pressure on the median nerve causing pain in the palm side of the wrist and pain and tingling in the fingers. The median nerve controls sensations to the palm side of the thumb and fingers, as well as impulses to some small muscles in the hand that allow the fingers and thumb to move. \n Symptoms usually start gradually, with frequent burning, tingling, or numbness in the palm of the hand and the fingers, especially the index, middle and ring fingers. Pain can sometimes travel up the arm and affect the shoulder. The symptoms often first appear during the night. As symptoms worsen, people might feel pain, weakness, or numbness in the hand and wrist, radiating up the arm during the day. Decreased grip strength may make it difficult to form a fist, grasp small objects, or perform other manual tasks. If not properly treated, CTS can cause irreversible nerve damage and permanent deterioration of muscle tissue. \n From an Oriental medicine perspective, a repetitive stress injury is seen as a disruption of the flow of Qi and Blood (Xue) within the area and associated with cold, dampness or wind penetrating the muscles and sinews. Acupuncture points, stretching exercises, herbal remedies and nutritional supplements are chosen to treat accordingly. \n In addition to reducing the swelling, inflammation and pain, acupuncture addresses any headaches, neck pain, shoulder stiffness and sleeping problems that often accompany this condition. Your treatment may also take into account any underlying conditions that contribute to the development of RSI including posture, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid problems, diabetes, and hormonal changes of pregnancy and menopause. \n Managing repetitive stress injuries often requires some lifestyle changes, and it can take time to work out a strategy that works best for you. \n Here are a few minor changes you can implement to minimize stress on your hands and wrists: \n Shoulders and neck should be relaxed to open the chest and allow your head to float upwards without strain. When using a keyboard, wrists should be in a relaxed middle position and in a straight line with your forearms at elbow height or slightly lower.\nIf you or someone you know suffers from a repetitive stress injury, Call us today to learn more about how acupuncture and Oriental medicine can help you. \n Our society puts a premium on our waking hours and has the tendency to underestimate the importance of a full-night’s sleep. Often, good sleep hygiene is an afterthought for many people. Millions of people are besieged with insomnia and look for quick fixes instead of exploring the root causes of the problem. \n Evening is a time to allow our minds and bodies to turn inward to our subconscious. Excessive lighting at night, evening shift work, evening computing, video games, television and late-night eating all serve to counteract the body’s natural rhythms. It’s no wonder people have trouble sleeping. Exposure to early morning light and dusk helps to regulate sleep hormones in the body. Rather than embrace nighttime we tend to let our minds wander from one element of stress to another keeping us up for hours or perhaps an entire evening. We are then forced to approach the new day without having benefited from the regenerative powers that night time brings. \n In Oriental medicine sleep occurs when the yang energy of the day folds into Yin – nighttime. Yin energy of the body is cooling and restorative. It is the time of day when our bodies turn inward and regenerate. This is the time we dream and explore the caverns of our unconscious mind. Conversely, daytime is yang, which is expansive. We expend the energy we have built up from the process of sleeping. Together, this is the cycle of yin and yang. \n To apply the concept of yin and yang to your everyday life try eating your last meal at least three hours before going to bed. If you are a hot excess type, you can cool your body down by avoiding hot and spicy food and drink. Avoid alcohol, coffee, chocolate any other stimulants, especially late in the day. \n Help circulate your body’s energy by working out or by gentle exercising. Build your body’s nutritive aspect by eating marrow based soups and stews, dark pigmented vegetables and fruits. Avoid overworking or over rumination as well. \n Meditation is an invaluable tool to help your brain unwind. Helping the body create a sense of calm meditation can reduce stress, increase feelings of well-being, and improve overall health. It is of specific use to help one increase alertness, relaxation and reflection even in “waking” states. Meditation is best practiced during the day to help ease your sleep patterns at night. \n One contributor to insomnia, stress, weakens the function of the liver, which in turn affects the health of your nerves. Acupuncture and Oriental medicine have a calming effect on the nervous system clearing obstructions in the muscle and nerve channels, assisting the flow of oxygen-enriched energy and relaxing the system. Common noted benefits include deeper breathing, improved digestive abilities, better sleeping patterns, and a general sense of well being. \n Practicing good sleep hygiene and keeping your body in sync with the rhythm of day and night can help your body cope with sleep deprivation give it an opportunity to get stronger and heal. \n By implementing just a few of the following suggestions you should notice a great improvement in your sleep and how you function in the daylight hours. \n   \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you. Together we implement lasting changes that will improve your energy, balance and health.

From a Western perspective, we know that longans contain large amounts of Vitamin C and phenolic compounds, which may help to detoxify and protect the liver. \n Alternate Tasks – Avoid doing the same task for more than a couple of hours at a time and alternate between tasks that use different muscle groups where possible. Fatigue is a sign that you need to take a break. Take small breaks to gently stretch and bend your hands and wrists and readjust your position. \n Reduce Pressure – Many people use more force than needed to perform tasks involving their hands, which can increase pressure and cause irritation. Be mindful of the speed and amount of pressure used to perform tasks. Ease up, slow down, and grip using your palm or whole hand to distribute the load. If using tools such as riveters or jackhammers for extended periods, take frequent breaks or operate the tool at a speed that causes the least amount of vibration. \n Cultivate Good Posture – Incorrect posture can cause your shoulders to roll forward, shortening neck and shoulder muscles and compressing nerves in your neck, which can affect your wrists, hands, and fingers. \n Maintain a routine sleep schedule. \n Make your bedroom a sanctuary. \n Keep it dark, cool, and quiet. \n Establish a sense of safety with your surroundings. \n Reduce nicotine, caffeine and alcohol use. \n Avoid rigorous exercise 3-5 hours prior to bedtime. \n Avoid heavy meals near bedtime. \n Position clock away from the bed. \n Limit television and computer use to early evening.",

  "inline_text": "\u003cimg src=\"https://organ-needles.com/100th/wp-content/themes/organ-100/images/logo.png\" alt=\"Organ Needle Co., Ltd.\"\u003e \n  \n 1920年、創業者増島良三が最初に手掛けた針は蓄音機針でした。国産のミシン針がなかった時代に「自ら優秀な国産ミシン針を製造する」という思いを胸に、当時、輸入品に依存していたミシン針の研究に1933年より本格的に着手しました。 \n Founder MASUJIMA Ryozo first handled gramophone needles in 1920. He began to study sewing machine needles in 1933. At that time,Japan depended on imported products at the time, so MASUJIMA Ryozo had the idea of “manufacturing excellent domestic sewing machine needles”. He realized his dream. \n 创始人增岛良三开始留声机针的制造于1920。当时日本的缝纫机针产品依赖进口，他立志“独立制造出优良的国产缝纫机针”，于1933年正式投身缝纫机针的研制。 \n 試行錯誤の末、ようやく自信のもてるミシン針が完成し、1938年に念願の市販を開始。  その時考案されたのが「オルガンを弾く婦人」の商標です。  当社名も、増島良三の姓を取って「増島製針所」の社名で事業展開が行われていましたが、多くの人々に親しまれたオルガンの呼称を社名に取り入れ、1963年に社名をオルガン針株式会社に変更します。 \n After a lot of trial and error, the sewing machine needle that MASUJIMA could be confident in, was finally completed and in 1938 the long-awaited product was ready for sale.The trademark image was designed and used for the first time. Business was carried as “Masujima Needle Factry”, but the name of the company was largely associated with the image of the organ, so it was incorporated into the new company name. In 1963, the company name was changed to ORGAN NEEDLE CO., LTD. \n 经过反复摸索和尝试，公司终于研制出满怀自信的缝纫机针，并于1938年实现了期待已久的上市销售。 当时设计的产品商标图案为“弹风琴的女士”。 公司在创立之初曾取增岛良三社长的姓氏，命名为“增岛制针所”，这一名称伴随事业发展。此后又选取人们熟知的“风琴”一词用以命名，1963年正式更名为风琴针株式会社。 \n 太平洋戦争末期には空襲を避けて中塩田村(現長野県上田市)に疎開。 1946年6月1日に創立記念式が行われ、増島良三は「立派な製品を世に送り出し、将来子孫に譲り渡すことのできる立派な工場を信州の地に築く」と誓ったのです。 \n Towards the end of the Pacific War (World War Ⅱ), MASUJIMA, worried about the air raids, evacuated the company to Nakashioda Village (now Ueda City Nagano Prefecture). In a memorial ceremony held on June 1st, 1946, MASUJIMA Ryozo pledged, “We will build a new factory in Shinshu, which will send high quality products around the world and be handed down to future generations.” \n 太平洋战争末期，为躲避空袭而迁厂至中盐田村(现长野県上田市)。 在1946年6月1日举行的成立纪念仪式上，增岛良三社长宣誓：“在信州的土地上建造一座为社会提供优质的产品，并可以将其传承给子孙后代的优秀工厂。” \n 増島良三は、良質な製品を適正価格で販売することこそものづくりを生業とする者の務め、という固い信念の持ち主で、生前、「納得のいかない製品は市場に出さない」「針と話ができるか」といった数々の言葉を遺しています。  そういった創業者の「品質第一」の理念は、今も社員一人ひとりに受け継がれています。 \n MASUJIMA Ryozo was a firm believer that the purpose of manufacturing is to sell quality products at reasonable prices. Throughout his life, he was often known to say “Don’t put inferior products on to the market.” and “Does the needle speak to you?” The founder’s “Quality First” philosophy is still passed on to every employee. \n 增岛良三社长坚信“以合理的价格提供优质的产品正是以制造为业者的职责所在”。他在生前留下了许多训言，例如“绝不放任不满意的产品流入市场”、“可以和机针心意相通吗”。 创始人的这种“质量第一”的理念如今被每一位员工所继承。 \n ミシン針製造で培った技術を活かし、1953年にメリヤス針の製造、翌1954年に販売を開始、1961年にフェルト針の製造、翌1962年に販売を開始します。 \n Utilizing technology cultivated in the manufacturing of sewing needles, we started manufacturing knitting machine needles in 1953 and began selling them the following year (1954). We then started manufacturing felting needles in 1961 and sales of these new needles commenced the next year (1962). \n 运用制造缝纫机针所积累的技术，1953年开始生产编织机针，1954年上市销售；1961年开始生产刺针，1962年上市销售。 \n 1959年、ついにミシン針の生産量が年間1億本を突破し、生産量で世界ナンバーワンの地位を確立します。 当社の生産量全体のうち3割は海外に輸出され、オルガン針の名は海外にも広く知られるようになりました。 \n In 1959, the sewing machine needle production exceeded 100 million annually, and our company was established as number one in the world in terms of production volume. About 30% of our total production is exported, and the brand name of ORGAN NEEDLE has become widely known overseas. \n 1959年，缝纫机针的年产量突破1亿根，确立了产量世界第一的地位。公司总产量的30%用于出口，风琴品牌开始名扬海外。 \n 創業者増島良三の逝去に伴い、増島芳美が社長に就任します。 増島芳美は良三の興した事業を足掛かりとして、事業の拡大を進めます。 \n MASUJIMA Yoshimi succeed as president after passing away of the founder, MASUJIMA Ryozo. MASUJIMA Yoshimi continues to expand the business, using the business practices established by Ryozo as a foothold. \n 创始人增岛良三社长去世，增岛芳美就任社长。增岛芳美社长立足于增岛良三社长所开创的事业，不断扩大规模。 \n 1967年の台湾進出を契機に熊本県(1970年) 、 香港(1974年)と海外・国内に生産拠点を設立しました。 1977年にドイツのR+M社と販売代理店契約を締結し、1981年にシンガポールに販売拠点を設立するなど海外の販売網拡大に注力します。 \n With the entry into Taiwan in 1967, we began expanding domestically and overseas, establishing production bases in Kumamoto Prefecture (1970) and Hong Kong (1974). Exclusive business partnership for the European market with RUPPEL+MAIHOFER GmbH begins in 1977. ORGAN NEEDLE(SINGAPORE)CO.PTE LTD.is established in 1981. \n 1967年进入台湾，并以此为契机，陆续在熊本县(1970年)、香港(1974年)等日本国内及海外建立生产基地。 与RUPPEL+MAIHOFER GmbH公司签订欧洲地区总代理店合同于1977。在新加坡创立ORGAN NEEDLE(SINGAPORE)CO.PTE LTD.于1981。 \n 繊維系針の製造ノウハウを活かして、精密加工が必要な電子関連部品の研究を行い、1979年に電化製品の基板の通電・機能検査を行うコンタクトプローブの販売を開始。 電子業界という新たな分野への進出を果たします。 \n We made a foray into a new field of electronics industry. Utilizing our needle processing technology, we researched electronic-related parts that require precision processing, and in 1979 we started selling contact probes that conduct electrical and functional inspections of electric circuit boards. \n 充分利用机针加工技术，针对需精密加工的电子零件展开研究，1979年，接触式探针开始上市销售，该产品可对电气化产品的电路板进行通电和性能检测。由此，公司成功进军电子行业这一全新领域。 \n 2代目増島芳美の跡を継いで増島良介が社長に就任します。 創業者が興し、2代目が固めた地盤をもとにお客様のニーズに応えながら積極的なグローバル展開を推進します。 \n MASUJIMA Ryosuke takes over as the president, succeeding MASUJIMA Yoshimi. Founded by MASUJIMA Ryozo, the second-generation owner MASUJIMA Yoshimi solidified the foundation of the company. MASUJIMA Ryosuke went on to actively promote global expansion while still meeting customer needs. \n 增岛良介接替增岛芳美（第二任社长），就任社长一职。 增岛良三社长开创了事业，第二任社长增岛芳美进一步巩固了集团事业的发展基础，增岛良介社长则在此基础上不断满足用户需求，同时积极推进业务的全球化布局。 \n グループ全体での針製造事業の再編に伴い、海外に生産会社を設立します。  1994年、ベトナム（ホーチミン）にORGAN NEEDLE (VIETNAM) CO.,LTDを設立（翌1995年より操業開始）し、2002年には中国（重慶）に重慶風琴業有限公司を設立（翌2003年より操業開始）します。  2010年にはベトナム工場で工業用ミシン針の一貫生産体制を構築。 リードタイムの短縮や品質向上へ取り組み、グループのミシン針事業の競争力向上に大いに貢献することになります。 \n With the reorganization of the needle manufacturing business, we established production companies overseas. 1994: ORGAN NEEDLE (VIETNAM) CO., LTD. established in Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh), structure construction completed in 1995. 2002: CHONGQING ORGAN NEEDLE CO.,LTD. established in China (Chongqing), structure construction completed in 2003. In 2010, we built an integrated production system for industrial sewing machine needles at our Vietnam factory. By working to improve lead times and quality, our group greatly contributed to improvements in competitiveness of sewing machine needle businesses. \n 在全集团范围内对机针制造业务进行重组，同时在海外建厂。 1994年在越南(胡志明)成立ORGAN NEEDLE (VIETNAM) CO., LTD.，1995年开始运营。2002年在中国(重庆)成立重庆风琴针业有限公司，2003年开始运营。 \n グループ内の生産会社と切磋琢磨し生産性を高めるために、上田市内のグループ会社にオルガン針株式会社の製造部門を統合し、オルガン製針株式会社を設立しました。 \n We established ORGAN NEEDLE CO., LTD. by working hard with the production companies in the group and making our manufacturing department independent. This was done with the aim of improve productivity. \n 为了促进与集团下属各生产工厂之间的良性竞争，提高生产效率，公司将制造部门从集团中独立出来，成立了风琴制针株式会社。 \n 2020年6月現在、オルガングループは海外2社、国内2社の生産拠点と海外6か所の販売拠点で構成されています。 「一本の針に心を込めて、世界の顧客に手渡そう」という社是のもと、世界中に広がるネットワークを通じ、お客様のニーズに応える製品をお届けします。 \n As of June 2020, the Organ Group consists of two overseas production companies, two domestic production sites, and six overseas sales bases. Under our mission statement of “Pour our heart and soul into every single needle we deliver around the world.” we deliver to customers products that meet the needs of our customers, through a network that spans the globe. \n 截至2020年6月，风琴集团旗下共拥有2处海外生产基地、2处日本国内生产基地以及6家海外销售基地。 我们将秉承“诚心倾注每根针，送到全球顾客手”的社训，通过遍布全球的业务网络，为顾客提供满足其需求的产品。 \n そして2020年、当社は創業100周年を迎えました。 私たちは独自技術を持つ針造り企業として、お客様の求める機能品質と社会の要請に応じた技術の研鑽に取り組み、お客様の信頼にお応えできる品質を第一としたものづくりを進めて参ります。 \n In 2020, we celebrated the 100th anniversary of our founding. As a needle-making company with our own unique technology, we will continue working to improve the quality of needles that customers have come to expect and build new technologies that meet the needs of society. We will proceed with manufacturing that puts quality first and earns the trust of customers. \n 集团在2020年迎来了创业100周年纪念。 作为一家拥有自主技术的机针制造企业，为了满足用户对产品性能和品质的追求，同时满足社会需求，我们将继续专注于相应技术的研究与开发，始终将不辜负顾客信赖的质量放在首位，推进产品制造工作。 \n Top \n Top message \n 100 years of history \n Photos",

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n  \n Adding nutrient-rich super foods to the diet can give men a healthy boost. \n Here are just a few foods that can help maintain muscle mass, prevent prostate cancer, and more. \n Avocados\nAvocados are a good source of vitamin K, dietary fiber, vitamin B6, vitamin C, folate and copper.  Rich in potassium, avocados contain more of this nutrient than bananas.  Potassium is needed to regulate nerves, heartbeat and, especially, blood pressure.  An added bonus for men: Avocados inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells. \n Blackberries\nBlackberries are packed with Vitamin C, calcium and magnesium, with more than double the amounts than their popular cousin, the blueberry.  Vitamin C is a powerful stress reducer that can lower blood pressure and return cortisol levels to normal faster when taken during periods of stress.  Magnesium and calcium act together to help regulate the nerves and muscle tone. \n Too little magnesium in your diet can cause nerve cells to become over activated and can trigger muscular tension, soreness, spasms, cramps, and fatigue.  Blackberries also score high on the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) scale assesses the antioxidant content of food: the higher the score, the better the food’s ability to neutralize cell-damaging free radicals that lead to cancer. \n Spinach\nSpinach is one of the most nutrient-dense foods in existence.  Spinach can help protect against prostate cancer, reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke, lower blood pressure and strengthen muscles. \n Walnuts\nWhen it comes to their health benefits, walnuts are the king of nuts. Richer in heart-healthy omega-3s than salmon, loaded with more anti-oxidants than red wine, and packing half as much muscle-building protein as chicken, walnuts are one of the all time super foods. \n Yogurt\nEating yogurt that contains live bacterial cultures every day improves digestive health, boosts the immune system, provides protection against cancer and may help you live longer.   Not all yogurts are probiotic though, so make sure the label says “live and active cultures.” \n Let us custom-tailor a treatment plan that will best suit your individual needs so that you can feel better quickly and safely! \n Name * \n Email * \n Website \n  \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n  \n Acupuncture views nutrition in a complex light, through the application of Oriental medicine wisdom to dietary habits. In short, certain foods are considered too yang, or hot to eat in excess during the warmer months, while others are prized for their yin ability to cool the body. Overall, the goal is balance between the internal yin and yang of the body. \n A healthy, nutritional diet, good sleep and moderate exercise can keep your skin and physical form at its best. \n For healthy skin, be sure to integrate these foods into your diet: \n Carrots and Sweet Potatoes: \n Healthy skin is directly dependent on the amount of vitamin A in our diet. Vitamin A acts as an antioxidant to neutralize harmful elements in our skin, helping to prevent wrinkles, resist infection and maintain the skin’s elasticity. Some of the best sources of Vitamin A are vegetables that are deep orange in color. \n Blackberries, Blueberries, Strawberries, and Plums:  \n In a study recently published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, these four fruits weighed in with the highest “total antioxidant capacity” of any food.  The antioxidants and other phytochemicals in these fruits can protect cells from damage and disintegration, thus guarding against premature aging. \n Salmon, Walnuts, Olive Oil, and Flax Seed:  \n Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are responsible for skin repair, moisture content, and overall elasticity, but because the body cannot produce its own EFAs, they must be obtained through the diet. Fish, walnuts, and flax seed oil are among the best sources for omega 3 fatty acids. Eating good-quality olive oil helps keep skin lubricated and keeps it looking and feeling healthier overall. Which olive oils are the best for your skin? Those labeled “cold pressed,” “expeller processed,” or “extra virgin” are the least processed forms. As a result, they contain the highest levels of antioxidant substances. \n Whole Wheat Bread, Brown Rice, Turkey, Tuna and Brazil Nuts:  \n Selenium is an antioxidant mineral responsible for tissue elasticity and healthy skin. It may also play an important role in preventing skin cancer, as some recent studies are showing that skin damaged by the sun may suffer fewer consequences if selenium levels are high. \n Green Tea:  \n Green tea’s ability to slow down the development of some signs of aging is attributed to its high levels of polyphenols, which have been well-documented for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Green tea may help prevent or reduce the risk of skin cancer according to a study published recently in the Archives of Dermatology, which shows that whether taken orally or applied to the skin, green tea can reduce the risk of damage from ultraviolet light and thus reduce the risk of skin cancer. \n Water : \n  Hydration plays a key role in keeping skin cells healthy. It is essential to maintaining your skin’s elasticity and suppleness. Keeping cells hydrated helps cells move nutrients in and toxins out, which helps keep skin clean and clear. \n Let us help you to optimize your skin health! \n Name * \n Email * \n Website \n  \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Acupuncture and Oriental medicine can be very effective at treating skin conditions. Treatments can provide quick relief for acute symptoms and significant and lasting relief from recurrent or chronic skin conditions. \n The skin reflects and reacts to imbalances within the body’s internal landscape and the effects of the environment. Internal disharmonies caused by strong emotions, diet, and your constitution, as well as environmental influences such as wind, dryness, dampness, and heat, can all contribute to the development of a skin disorder. To keep your skin healthy and beautiful on the outside, you must work on the inside of your body as well. Increasing the flow of energy, blood and lymph circulation improves the skin’s natural healthy color. \n Promotion of collagen production increases muscle tone and elasticity, helping to firm the skin. Stimulating the formation of body fluids nourishes the skin and encourages it to be moister, softer, smoother and more lustrous. \n General skin conditions that can be treated with acupuncture and Oriental medicine include acne, dermatitis, eczema, pruritus, psoriasis, rosacea, shingles and urticaria (hives). Oriental medicine does not recognize skin problems as one particular syndrome. Instead, it aims to treat the specific symptoms that are unique to each individual using a variety of techniques with acupuncture, such as herbal medicine, bodywork, lifestyle/dietary recommendations and energetic exercises to restore imbalances found in the body. Therefore, if 10 patients are treated with Oriental medicine for eczema, each patient will receive a unique, customized treatment with different lifestyle and dietary recommendations. \n If you suffer from a skin condition or would like to know how to optimize your skin health, Contact One Essence Healing to learn more about how acupuncture and Oriental medicine can help you. \n Name * \n Email * \n Website \n  \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n More than 95 million Americans suffer from digestive disorders ranging from constipation, diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome to more serious conditions such as acid reflux (GERD), ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. In fact, more than 35 million physician office visits a year are due to gastrointestinal complaints. Reports are confirming that acupuncture and Oriental medicine can offer relief from even the most complex digestive problems. \n Evidence that Oriental medicine has been used for digestive disorders can be found in early medical literature dating back to 3 AD, where specific acupuncture points and herbal formulas for borborygmus (rumbling or gurgling in the intestines), abdominal pain and diarrhea with pain are discussed. \n According to Oriental medical theory, most digestive disorders are due to disharmony in the spleen and stomach. The spleen plays a central part in the health and vitality of the body, taking a lead role in the assimilation of nutrients and maintenance of physical strength. It turns digested food from the stomach into usable nutrients and qi (energy). Many schools of thought have been formed around this organ; the premise being that the proper functioning of the”‘middle” is the key to all aspects of vitality. \n By taking into account a person’s constitution and varied symptoms, a treatment plan is designed specifically for the individual to bring their “middle” back into harmony and optimize the proper functioning of the digestive system. A variety of techniques can be used during treatment including acupuncture, lifestyle/dietary recommendations and energetic exercises to restore digestive health. \n Is your digestive system functioning as well as it could? Acupuncture and Oriental medicine are extremely effective at treating a wide array of digestive disorders. Contact us today to learn more about how acupuncture and Oriental medicine can be integrated into your digestive wellness plan! \n Name * \n Email * \n Website \n  \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Repetitive stress injuries (RSI) are the most common job-related injuries and are responsible for the highest number of days lost among all work related injuries. One of the most well-known types of repetitive stress injury, carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) accounts for over two million visits to physicians’ offices and approximately 465,000 carpal tunnel release operations each year, making it the most frequent surgery of the hand and wrist. \n Symptoms of repetitive stress injuries include tightness, stiffness, pain, tingling, numbness, coldness and loss of strength in the arm. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a repetitive stress injury that refers specifically to the inflammation of a specific ligament that puts pressure on the median nerve. \n Acupuncture is extremely effective for treating repetitive stress injuries including carpal tunnel syndrome; eliminating the need for surgery or the use of anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids. In fact, one of the most common reasons that people get acupuncture is for repetitive stress injuries. Recent studies even suggest that acupuncture may be more effective than corticosteroids when it comes to treating CTS. \n The carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway in the wrist made up of ligaments and bones. The median nerve and the tendons that connect the fingers to the muscles of the forearm pass through this tightly spaced tunnel. \n Carpal tunnel syndrome, also known as median nerve entrapment, occurs when swelling or irritation of the tendons in the carpal tunnel results in pressure on the median nerve causing pain in the palm side of the wrist and pain and tingling in the fingers. The median nerve controls sensations to the palm side of the thumb and fingers, as well as impulses to some small muscles in the hand that allow the fingers and thumb to move. \n Symptoms usually start gradually, with frequent burning, tingling, or numbness in the palm of the hand and the fingers, especially the index, middle and ring fingers. Pain can sometimes travel up the arm and affect the shoulder. The symptoms often first appear during the night. As symptoms worsen, people might feel pain, weakness, or numbness in the hand and wrist, radiating up the arm during the day. Decreased grip strength may make it difficult to form a fist, grasp small objects, or perform other manual tasks. If not properly treated, CTS can cause irreversible nerve damage and permanent deterioration of muscle tissue. \n From an Oriental medicine perspective, a repetitive stress injury is seen as a disruption of the flow of Qi and Blood (Xue) within the area and associated with cold, dampness or wind penetrating the muscles and sinews. Acupuncture points, stretching exercises, herbal remedies and nutritional supplements are chosen to treat accordingly. \n In addition to reducing the swelling, inflammation and pain, acupuncture addresses any headaches, neck pain, shoulder stiffness and sleeping problems that often accompany this condition. Your treatment may also take into account any underlying conditions that contribute to the development of RSI including posture, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid problems, diabetes, and hormonal changes of pregnancy and menopause. \n Managing repetitive stress injuries often requires some lifestyle changes, and it can take time to work out a strategy that works best for you. \n Here are a few minor changes you can implement to minimize stress on your hands and wrists: \n Shoulders and neck should be relaxed to open the chest and allow your head to float upwards without strain. When using a keyboard, wrists should be in a relaxed middle position and in a straight line with your forearms at elbow height or slightly lower.\nIf you or someone you know suffers from a repetitive stress injury, Call us today to learn more about how acupuncture and Oriental medicine can help you. \n Name * \n Email * \n Website \n  \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

Fatigue is a sign that you need to take a break. Take small breaks to gently stretch and bend your hands and wrists and readjust your position. \n Reduce Pressure – Many people use more force than needed to perform tasks involving their hands, which can increase pressure and cause irritation. Be mindful of the speed and amount of pressure used to perform tasks. Ease up, slow down, and grip using your palm or whole hand to distribute the load. If using tools such as riveters or jackhammers for extended periods, take frequent breaks or operate the tool at a speed that causes the least amount of vibration. \n Cultivate Good Posture – Incorrect posture can cause your shoulders to roll forward, shortening neck and shoulder muscles and compressing nerves in your neck, which can affect your wrists, hands, and fingers.",

  "inline_text": "Dear LDS Church Leader: \n The New LDS Organist is a free course designed to help LDS pianists adapt their skills to the organ as soon as possible. It can be helpful for pianists who must begin serving as an organist in only a few weeks, for organists who have had little or no formal organ training, for organists who could use a review of basic organ playing skills, and for pianists who would like to begin adapting their skills to the organ. \n The course is available free over the Internet as twelve audio lessons. There is a total of just over four hours of instruction, with each lesson lasting between five and thirty-five minutes plus pause time. The lessons involve listening to instruction, trying out new skills at the organ, and playing simplified hymns. For more detailed information about the course, click here. \n WHAT IS NEEDED? \n The New LDS Organist lessons and packet (free). If the organist does not have an mp3 player and/or access to a computer, an inexpensive player with the lessons preloaded is available through the website given above. Other alternatives are also described. \n Access. This is most important. Ideally, the lessons are taken right at the organ console with an mp3 player. The organist will need regular access to the meetinghouse organ for taking the lessons and for practice between lessons–at least three visits per week. If possible, it is suggested that a key be checked out to the organist to facilitate and encourage regular practice. Regularly borrowing a key from another person in the locality usually becomes too unwieldy for the organist to continue, leading eventually to discouragement and quitting. \n Encouragement. It would be most valuable if another organist or musician could meet with the organist periodically to listen and offer suggestions. Frequent encouragement from priesthood and other leaders can provide valuable motivation as the organist spends the many hours required to learn to play well. \n Best wishes as you encourage inspiring music in the church service. \n Don Cook\nAssociate professor of music (organ)\nBrigham Young University \n The New LDS Organist was produced by Dr. Don Cook of the Brigham Young University School of Music, assisted by graduate students Jane Dye, Ruth Eldredge, and Shinji Inagi. \n Copyright © 2007 by Brigham Young University.

Continuing Your Organ Training (15 min.)\nThe New LDS Organist\nA Guide Through the First Months\n\n\nDear LDS Church Leader:\nThe New LDS Organist is a free course designed to help LDS pianists adapt their skills to the organ as soon as possible. It can be helpful for pianists who must begin serving as an organist in only a few weeks, for organists who have had little or no formal organ training, for organists who could use a review of basic organ playing skills, and for pianists who would like to begin adapting their skills to the organ.\nThe course is available free over the Internet as twelve audio lessons. There is a total of just over four hours of instruction, with each lesson lasting between five and thirty-five minutes plus pause time. The lessons involve listening to instruction, trying out new skills at the organ, and playing simplified hymns. For more detailed information about the course, click here.\nWHAT IS NEEDED?\nThe New LDS Organist lessons and packet (free). If the organist does not have an mp3 player and/or access to a computer, an inexpensive player with the lessons preloaded is available through the website given above. Other alternatives are also described.\nAccess. This is most important. Ideally, the lessons are taken right at the organ console with an mp3 player. The organist will need regular access to the meetinghouse organ for taking the lessons and for practice between lessons–at least three visits per week. If possible, it is suggested that a key be checked out to the organist to facilitate and encourage regular practice. Regularly borrowing a key from another person in the locality usually becomes too unwieldy for the organist to continue, leading eventually to discouragement and quitting.\nEncouragement. It would be most valuable if another organist or musician could meet with the organist periodically to listen and offer suggestions. Frequent encouragement from priesthood and other leaders can provide valuable motivation as the organist spends the many hours required to learn to play well.\nBest wishes as you encourage inspiring music in the church service.\nDon Cook\nAssociate professor of music (organ)\nBrigham Young University\n\n\n\nLesson Titles\n\n1.

In that capacity he serves as organ area coordinator, as university carillonneur, and oversees the group organ program. Formerly he held associate organist/choirmaster positions at Christ Church Cranbrook, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, and at First United Methodist Church, Lubbock, Texas. He toured Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia with the Lubbock choir, and accompanied the Parish Choir of Christ Church Cranbrook on a singing tour of England. \n After earning Bachelor and Master of Music degrees in organ at Brigham Young University, he received the Doctor of Musical Arts degree in Organ Performance from the University of Kansas. His principal organ teachers were J.J. Keeler at BYU and James Moeser at KU. For many years he served as head of the instrumental area for the BYU Workshop on Church Music, and currently directs the annual BYU Organ Workshop, founded in 2002.

Prior to his appointment at BYU he worked as full-time Director of Music and Organist at Grace United Methodist Church in Wilmington, Delaware for 19 years, where he became known throughout the region for his fine choral conducting, organ playing, composing, and arranging. Since 1989 he has maintained a successful studio of private organ, piano, and conducting students. \n A native of Midvale, Utah, Dr. Harmon received early organ training from Dorothy Bradford and Linda Wildman. He completed a Bachelor of Music at BYU studying with Parley Belnap, Richard Elliott, and Don Cook. Graduate studies were at The Eastman School of Music, where he earned a Master of Music and Doctorate of Musical Arts, studying with Russell Saunders, David Craighead, and Michael Farris. Working as the Eastman School’s Organ Teaching Assistant, Dr. Harmon trained non-major organ students at the undergraduate, masters, and doctorate levels for three years. He was on the faculty of the Eastman School’s Community Education Division for four years. \n Acclaimed as “one of the finest products of the American organ school,” [La Nuova Venezia] Dr. Harmon has performed in Europe, South America, and the United States. Performance venues have included Longwood Gardens, The Salt Lake Tabernacle, New York City’s Carnegie Hall, and the Church of Saint Nicolo dei Mendicoli in Venice, Italy. He serves as a Guest Organist at the Salt Lake Tabernacle on Temple Square, a service he has rendered since 1991. He has adjudicated for regional, national, and international organ competitions. Active in the American Guild of Organists, Dr. Harmon has served as chapter Dean, Sub-dean, and twice as Co-director of the Delaware Pipe Organ Encounter. \n An award-winning composer, Dr. Harmon is known nationally for his creative and accessible organ, handbell, and choral compositions. His Requiem, for SATB chorus, soprano, and orchestra, has garnered accolades from around the country. \n Neil served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in São Paulo, Brazil.

Prior to his appointment at BYU he worked as full-time Director of Music and Organist at Grace United Methodist Church in Wilmington, Delaware for 19 years, where he became known throughout the region for his fine choral conducting, organ playing, composing, and arranging. Since 1989 he has maintained a successful studio of private organ, piano, and conducting students.\nA native of Midvale, Utah, Dr. Harmon received early organ training from Dorothy Bradford and Linda Wildman. He completed a Bachelor of Music at BYU studying with Parley Belnap, Richard Elliott, and Don Cook. Graduate studies were at The Eastman School of Music, where he earned a Master of Music and Doctorate of Musical Arts, studying with Russell Saunders, David Craighead, and Michael Farris. Working as the Eastman School’s Organ Teaching Assistant, Dr. Harmon trained non-major organ students at the undergraduate, masters, and doctorate levels for three years. He was on the faculty of the Eastman School’s Community Education Division for four years.\nAcclaimed as “one of the finest products of the American organ school,” [La Nuova Venezia] Dr. Harmon has performed in Europe, South America, and the United States. Performance venues have included Longwood Gardens, The Salt Lake Tabernacle, New York City’s Carnegie Hall, and the Church of Saint Nicolo dei Mendicoli in Venice, Italy. He serves as a Guest Organist at the Salt Lake Tabernacle on Temple Square, a service he has rendered since 1991. He has adjudicated for regional, national, and international organ competitions. Active in the American Guild of Organists, Dr. Harmon has served as chapter Dean, Sub-dean, and twice as Co-director of the Delaware Pipe Organ Encounter.\nAn award-winning composer, Dr. Harmon is known nationally for his creative and accessible organ, handbell, and choral compositions. His Requiem, for SATB chorus, soprano, and orchestra, has garnered accolades from around the country.\nNeil served a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in São Paulo, Brazil. He and his wife, Anese, are the parents of five children.\nEducation\nBM, Organ Performance, Brigham Young University, 1992\nMM, Organ Performance, Eastman School of Music, 1994\nDMA, Organ Performance, Eastman School of Music, 1998\nCourses Taught\nBasic Organ Skills (Music 115)\nOrgan Techniques and Literature (Music 116R)\nPrivate Organ Instruction (Music 160R, 260R, 360R, 460R, 560R, 660R)\nOrgan Literature (Music 404A, 404B)\nOrgan Practicum (Music 466R)\nGraduate Organ Literature (Music 505A, 505B)\nAdvanced Keyboard Harmony (Music 591)\nBYU Organ Workshop\n",

  "inline_text": "ORGAN LAB HARDWARE \n The BYU Organ Lab (E-354) \n The heart of non-major organ study at the Brigham Young University School of Music is the Organ lab. Located in room E-354 of the Harris Fine Arts Center, this lab is the largest one of its kind. The lab is designed for class and semi-private instruction for up to twelve students. Each student sits at a late-model two-manual Allen organ, seven of which are equipped with an iPad designed to deliver organ study materials. Students have access to the lab for practice and study seventeen hours per day. \n The group organ students are the most active patrons of the organ lab. During a typical week they will visit there five times: twice for class instruction, and three more times for individual practice and study. Instructors spend most class time listening to individual students play their assignments while other class members use headphones to practice and study individually. \n Most students use the iPads to study lessons on OrganTutor Online, an interactive multimedia organ tutorial. However, because the iPads are connected to the campus network, they provide access to the growing pool of organ study-related resources on the Internet.On Campus Students\n\n\tMusic Majors\n\t\n\t\tDegree Programs\n\t\tCareer and Income Opportunities\n\t\tAdmissions and Scholarship\n\t\tStudents\n\t\n\n\tNon-Music Majors\n\t\n\t\tGroup Organ Study\n\t\tPrivate Organ Study\n\t\tOrgan Registration\n\t\n\n\n \n Music Majors\n\t\n\t\tDegree Programs\n\t\tCareer and Income Opportunities\n\t\tAdmissions and Scholarship\n\t\tStudents\n\t\n \n Degree Programs \n Career and Income Opportunities \n Admissions and Scholarship \n Students \n Non-Music Majors\n\t\n\t\tGroup Organ Study\n\t\tPrivate Organ Study\n\t\tOrgan Registration\n\t\n \n Group Organ Study \n Private Organ Study \n Organ Registration \n Off Campus Students\n\n\tFinding An Organ Teacher\n\tBYU Programs for Off-Campus Organists (Organ Certification)\n\t\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 1-2\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 3-6\n\t\tRepertoire for BYU Independent Study Organ Courses\n\t\n\n\tContinuing Your Organ Training PDF\n\tMaterials Needed For Independent Study Organ Classes PDF\n\tBYU Organ Workshop\n\tOrganTutor\n\tMentor Instructions\n\n \n Finding An Organ Teacher \n BYU Programs for Off-Campus Organists (Organ Certification)\n\t\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 1-2\n\t\tIndependent Study Organ Levels 3-6\n\t\tRepertoire for BYU Independent Study Organ Courses\n\t\n \n Independent Study Organ Levels 1-2 \n Independent Study Organ Levels 3-6 \n Repertoire for BYU Independent Study Organ Courses \n Continuing Your Organ Training PDF \n Materials Needed For Independent Study Organ Classes PDF \n BYU Organ Workshop \n OrganTutor \n Mentor Instructions \n Events\n\n\tBYU Organ Workshop\n\tPipe Organ Study Tour of Germany\n\tAGO Events\n\t\n\t\tUtah Valley Chapter AGO\n\t\tSalt Lake City Chapter AGO\n\t\n\n\n \n BYU Organ Workshop \n Pipe Organ Study Tour of Germany \n AGO Events\n\t\n\t\tUtah Valley Chapter AGO\n\t\tSalt Lake City Chapter AGO\n\t\n \n Utah Valley Chapter AGO \n Salt Lake City Chapter AGO \n Ward Organists\n\n\tThe New Ward Organist\n\tWard Organist Training\n\t\n\t\tOrgan Training Outlines\n\t\n\n\tTraveling Organ Workshops\n\tOrgan Training Resources PDF\n\tU of U Group Organ Instruction\n\tUsing OrganTutor PDF\n\tFree Accompaniment PDF\n\n \n The New Ward Organist \n Ward Organist Training\n\t\n\t\tOrgan Training Outlines\n\t\n \n Organ Training Outlines \n Traveling Organ Workshops \n Organ Training Resources PDF \n U of U Group Organ Instruction \n Using OrganTutor PDF \n Free Accompaniment PDF \n Workshops\n\n\tOnline Training Sessions\n\t2021 BYU Organ Workshop\n\tTraveling Organ Workshops\n\n \n Online Training Sessions \n 2021 BYU Organ Workshop \n Traveling Organ Workshops \n Info \u0026 Reference\n\n\tOrgan Training Resources PDF\n\tCarol Dean\n\tContinuing Your Organ Training\n\tDouglas E.

The console came from another organ owned by the LDS church.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\nPedal\nSwell\nGreat\nPositif\n\n\n\n\n16 Gedeckt\n16 Gedeckt\n16 Gedeckt (Sw)\n16 Flute\n\n\n8 Principal\n8 Gedeckt\n8 Principal\n8 Flute\n\n\n8 Flute (Pos)\n8 Salicional\n8 Harmonic Flute (Pos)\n8 Dolce\n\n\n8 Gedeckt (Sw)\n8 Celeste\n8 Salicional\n4 Rohr Flöte\n\n\n4 Principal\n8 Dolce (Pos)\n8 Rohr Flöte (Pos)\n4 Salicional (Sw)\n\n\n4 Flute (Pos)\n4 Rohr Flöte\n4 Prestant\n4 Dolce\n\n\n4 Gedeckt (Sw)\n4 Salicional\n4 Flute (Pos)\n2 2/3 Nazard\n\n\n2 Salicional (Sw)\n2 2/3 Quint (Pos)\n2 Fifteenth\n2 Flute\n\n\n16 Bassoon\n2 Gedeckt\n2 II Mixutre (Pos)\n2 Dolce\n\n\n8 Bassoon (Sw)\n2 Salicional\n8 Bassoon (Sw)\n1 1/3 Quint\n\n\n4 Bassoon (Sw)\n2 Dolce (Pos)\nGreat 4\n8 Bassoon (Sw)\n\n\nGreat to Pedal 8\n16 Bassoon\nSwell to Great 16\n16 Positif\n\n\nSwell to Pedal 8\n8 Bassoon\nSwell to Great 8\n4 Positif\n\n\nSwell to Pedal 4\nTremulant\nSwell to Great 4\nPositif Unison Off\n\n\nPositif to Pedal 8\nSwell 16\nPositif to Great 8\nSwell to Positif 16\n\n\n\nSwell 4\n\nSwell to Positif 8\n\n\n\nSwell Unison Off\n\nSwell to Positif 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n",

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Our society puts a premium on our waking hours and has the tendency to underestimate the importance of a full-night’s sleep. Often, good sleep hygiene is an afterthought for many people. Millions of people are besieged with insomnia and look for quick fixes instead of exploring the root causes of the problem. \n Evening is a time to allow our minds and bodies to turn inward to our subconscious. Excessive lighting at night, evening shift work, evening computing, video games, television and late-night eating all serve to counteract the body’s natural rhythms. It’s no wonder people have trouble sleeping. Exposure to early morning light and dusk helps to regulate sleep hormones in the body. Rather than embrace nighttime we tend to let our minds wander from one element of stress to another keeping us up for hours or perhaps an entire evening. We are then forced to approach the new day without having benefited from the regenerative powers that night time brings. \n In Oriental medicine sleep occurs when the yang energy of the day folds into Yin – nighttime. Yin energy of the body is cooling and restorative. It is the time of day when our bodies turn inward and regenerate. This is the time we dream and explore the caverns of our unconscious mind. Conversely, daytime is yang, which is expansive. We expend the energy we have built up from the process of sleeping. Together, this is the cycle of yin and yang. \n To apply the concept of yin and yang to your everyday life try eating your last meal at least three hours before going to bed. If you are a hot excess type, you can cool your body down by avoiding hot and spicy food and drink. Avoid alcohol, coffee, chocolate any other stimulants, especially late in the day. \n Help circulate your body’s energy by working out or by gentle exercising. Build your body’s nutritive aspect by eating marrow based soups and stews, dark pigmented vegetables and fruits. Avoid overworking or over rumination as well. \n Meditation is an invaluable tool to help your brain unwind. Helping the body create a sense of calm meditation can reduce stress, increase feelings of well-being, and improve overall health. It is of specific use to help one increase alertness, relaxation and reflection even in “waking” states. Meditation is best practiced during the day to help ease your sleep patterns at night. \n One contributor to insomnia, stress, weakens the function of the liver, which in turn affects the health of your nerves. Acupuncture and Oriental medicine have a calming effect on the nervous system clearing obstructions in the muscle and nerve channels, assisting the flow of oxygen-enriched energy and relaxing the system. Common noted benefits include deeper breathing, improved digestive abilities, better sleeping patterns, and a general sense of well being. \n Practicing good sleep hygiene and keeping your body in sync with the rhythm of day and night can help your body cope with sleep deprivation give it an opportunity to get stronger and heal. \n By implementing just a few of the following suggestions you should notice a great improvement in your sleep and how you function in the daylight hours. \n   \n Name * \n Email * \n Website \n  \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

The hook-down pedals near the pedal keys are pedal stops and manual/pedal couplers.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\nGreat\nSwell\nPedal\n\n\n\n\n8 Gedackt\n8 Holzegedackt\n8 Flute\n\n\n4 Rohrflote (shared with Great; either/or)\n4 Rohrflote (shared with Great; either/or)\n4 Flute\n\n\n2 Prinzipal\n8 Regal (plays on both manuals when engaged)\nI/Ped (activated by pedal lever)\n\n\n8 Regal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n",

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Patients suffering TMJ (temporomandibular joint disorder) can find relief from acupuncture.  Research conducted at the Ribeirão Preto Dental School, São Paulo University in Brazil, found that after 3 months of acupuncture, patients with TMJ experienced significantly less pain, increased strength of their bite and decreased EMG activity of the masticatory muscles. \n Temporomandibular joint and muscle disorders (TMJ disorders) are problems or symptoms of the chewing muscles and joints that connect your lower jaw to your skull.  17 patients were studied using acupuncture points for TMJ.  EMG measures were acquired before and after the treatment. The data collected at rest, protrusion, left and right laterality, and clenching were normalized by maximum voluntary contraction. Maximal bite force in right and left molar regions were also measured. \n The researchers found decreased EMG activity at rest, protrusion, left and right laterality, and clenching; as well as increased values of maximal bite force after acupuncture treatment. \n The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine, 15 Issue 12: December 15, 2009 \n By: International Anesthesia Research Society (IARS) \n The scientific validity of traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of pain received a nod of support in the May issue of Anesthesia \u0026 Analgesia, official journal of the International Anesthesia Research Society (IARS). \n Dr. Philip Lang and colleagues of the University of Munich used quantitative sensory testing to identify changes in pain sensitivity with acupuncture in 24 healthy volunteers. After applying acupuncture to the leg, the researchers found that pain thresholds increased by up to 50 percent. Effects were noted in both the treated leg and the untreated (contralateral) leg. \n Quantitative sensory testing is used clinically to help physicians understand specific injuries in nerve fibers associated with chronic pain. It includes tests of both thermal perception (heat and cold), and mechanical perception (pressure applied to the skin). The patterns of response provide diagnostic information in patients with nerve injury regarding the type of nerve involved, and possible treatments. \n The results pointed to two nerve fibers—the “A delta” pain fibers and the “C” pain fibers—as being specifically affected by acupuncture. Although the effects were modest, the researchers believe they provide the basis for future studies in individuals with chronic pain, where the effects might be more dramatic. \n The study also supported the effects of three different forms of acupuncture: manual acupuncture needling alone and with the addition of high-frequency and low-frequency electrical stimulation. All treatments were performed by an experienced acupuncturist, applied to acupuncture points commonly used in pain management. \n The results provide a scientific background for the ancient practice of acupuncture, according to Dr. Dominik Irnich, Head of the Multidisciplinary Pain Centre, Department of Anesthesiology, University of Munich, and the study’s leading author. Additionally, Dr. Irnich notes, “Our results show that contralateral stimulation leads to a remarkable pain relief. This suggests that acupuncturists should needle contralaterally if the affected side is too painful or not accessible—for example, if the skin is injured or there is a dressing in place.” \n Dr. Steven L. Shafer, Editor-in-Chief of Anesthesia \u0026 Analgesia and Professor of Anesthesiology at Columbia University, views the results as an important preliminary finding. “Reproducible findings are the cornerstone of scientific inquiry,” Dr. Shafer comments. “The authors have clearly described their methodology, and their findings. If other laboratories can reproduce these results in properly controlled studies, then this provides further support for the scientific basis of acupuncture. Additionally, the ability of quantitative sensory testing to identify specific types of nerves involved in pain transmission may help direct research into the mechanism of acupuncture analgesia.” \n More than 45 million Americans (one in six) suffer from chronic headaches, 20 million of whom are women. Scientific research shows that acupuncture can be more effective than medication in reducing the severity and frequency of chronic headaches. \n The pain that headache and migraine sufferers endure can impact every aspect of their lives.  A widely accepted form of treatment for headaches, acupuncture can offer powerful relief without the side effects that prescription and over-the-counter drugs can cause. \n Headaches and migraines, as well as their underlying causes have been treated successfully with acupuncture and Oriental medicine for thousands of years.  Acupuncture and Oriental medicine can be used alone in the management and treatment of headaches, or as part of a comprehensive treatment program. \n Oriental Medicine does not recognize migraines and chronic headaches as one particular syndrome. Instead, it aims to treat the specific symptoms that are unique to each individual using a variety of of techniques such as acupuncture, tui-na massage, and energetic exercises to restore imbalances found in the body. Therefore, your diagnosis and treatment will depend on a number of variables including: \n Your answers to these questions will help your practitioner create a treatment plan specifically for you. The basic foundation for Oriental medicine is that there is a life energy flowing through the body which is termed Qi (pronounced chee). This energy flows through the body on channels known as meridians that connect all of our major organs.  According to Oriental medical theory, illness or pain arises when the cyclical flow of Qi in the meridians becomes unbalanced. Acupuncture stimulates specific points located on or near the surface of the skin to alter various biochemical and physiological conditions that cause aches and pains or illness. \n The length, number and frequency of treatments will vary. Typical treatments last from five to 30 minutes, with the patient being treated one or two times a week. Some headaches, migraines and related symptoms are relieved after the first treatment, while more severe or chronic ailments often require multiple treatments. \n Since the early seventies, studies around the globe have suggested that acupuncture is an effective treatment for migraines and headaches.  Researchers at Duke University Medical Center analyzed the results of more than 30 studies on acupuncture as a pain reliever for a variety of ailments, including chronic headaches. They found that acupuncture decreases pain with fewer side effects and can be less expensive than medication.  Researchers found that using acupuncture as an alternative for pain relief also reduced the need for post-operative pain medications. \n In a study published in the November 1999 issue of Cephalalgia, scientists evaluated the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of migraines and recurrent headaches by systematically reviewing 22 randomized controlled trials. A total of 1,042 patients were examined. It was found that headache and migraine sufferers experienced significantly more relief from acupuncture than patients who were administered “sham” acupuncture. \n A clinical observation, published in a 2002 edition of the Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine, studied 50 patients presenting with various types of headaches who were treated with scalp acupuncture. The results of this study showed that 98 percent of patients treated with scalp acupuncture experienced no headaches or only occasional, mild headaches in the six months following care. \n In a case study, published in the June 2003 Issue of Medical Acupuncture, doctors found that acupuncture resulted in the resolution or reduction in the frequency and severity of cluster headaches, and a decrease or discontinuation of pain medications. It was concluded that acupuncture can be used to provide sustained relief from cluster headaches and to stimulate the body’s natural production of adrenal cortisol to aid in discontinuing corticosteroids. \n According to the July 2005 issue of the British Medical Journal, a randomized controlled trial in Germany found that acupuncture cut tension headache rates almost in half.  Researchers divided 270 patients who reported similarly severe tension headaches into three groups for the study. Over the project’s eight-week period, one group received traditional acupuncture, one received only minimal acupuncture, and the third group received neither treatment. Those receiving the traditional acupuncture reported headache rates of nearly half that of those who received no treatments, suffering 7 fewer days of headaches. The minimal acupuncture group suffered 6.6 fewer days, and the non-acupuncture group suffered 1.5 fewer days.  The improvements continued for months after the treatments were concluded, rising slightly as time went on. \n Do you or someone you know suffer from headaches or migraines? \n More than 95 million Americans suffer from digestive disorders ranging from constipation, diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome to more serious conditions such as acid reflux (GERD), ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.  In fact, more than 35 million physician office visits a year are due to gastrointestinal complaints.  Reports are confirming that acupuncture and Oriental medicine can offer relief from even the most complex digestive problems. \n Evidence that Oriental medicine has been used for digestive disorders can be found in early medical literature dating back to 3 AD, where specific acupuncture points and herbal formulas for borborygmus (rumbling or gurgling in the intestines), abdominal pain and diarrhea with pain are discussed. \n According to Oriental medical theory, most digestive disorders are due to disharmony in the spleen and stomach. The spleen plays a central part in the health and vitality of the body, taking a lead role in the assimilation of nutrients and maintenance of physical strength. It turns digested food from the stomach into usable nutrients and qi (energy). Many schools of thought have been formed around this organ; the premise being that the proper functioning of the”‘middle” is the key to all aspects of vitality. \n By taking into account a person’s constitution and varied symptoms, a treatment plan is designed specifically for the individual to bring their “middle” back into harmony and optimize the proper functioning of the digestive system. A variety of techniques can be used during treatment including acupuncture, lifestyle/dietary recommendations and energetic exercises to restore digestive health. \n Is your digestive system functioning as well as it could? Acupuncture and Oriental medicine are extremely effective at treating a wide array of digestive disorders. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

The data collected at rest, protrusion, left and right laterality, and clenching were normalized by maximum voluntary contraction. Maximal bite force in right and left molar regions were also measured. \n The researchers found decreased EMG activity at rest, protrusion, left and right laterality, and clenching; as well as increased values of maximal bite force after acupuncture treatment. \n The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine, 15 Issue 12: December 15, 2009 \n Name * \n Email * \n Website \n  \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n By: International Anesthesia Research Society (IARS) \n The scientific validity of traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of pain received a nod of support in the May issue of Anesthesia \u0026 Analgesia, official journal of the International Anesthesia Research Society (IARS). \n Dr. Philip Lang and colleagues of the University of Munich used quantitative sensory testing to identify changes in pain sensitivity with acupuncture in 24 healthy volunteers. After applying acupuncture to the leg, the researchers found that pain thresholds increased by up to 50 percent. Effects were noted in both the treated leg and the untreated (contralateral) leg. \n Quantitative sensory testing is used clinically to help physicians understand specific injuries in nerve fibers associated with chronic pain. It includes tests of both thermal perception (heat and cold), and mechanical perception (pressure applied to the skin). The patterns of response provide diagnostic information in patients with nerve injury regarding the type of nerve involved, and possible treatments. \n The results pointed to two nerve fibers—the “A delta” pain fibers and the “C” pain fibers—as being specifically affected by acupuncture. Although the effects were modest, the researchers believe they provide the basis for future studies in individuals with chronic pain, where the effects might be more dramatic. \n The study also supported the effects of three different forms of acupuncture: manual acupuncture needling alone and with the addition of high-frequency and low-frequency electrical stimulation. All treatments were performed by an experienced acupuncturist, applied to acupuncture points commonly used in pain management. \n The results provide a scientific background for the ancient practice of acupuncture, according to Dr. Dominik Irnich, Head of the Multidisciplinary Pain Centre, Department of Anesthesiology, University of Munich, and the study’s leading author. Additionally, Dr. Irnich notes, “Our results show that contralateral stimulation leads to a remarkable pain relief. This suggests that acupuncturists should needle contralaterally if the affected side is too painful or not accessible—for example, if the skin is injured or there is a dressing in place.” \n Dr. Steven L. Shafer, Editor-in-Chief of Anesthesia \u0026 Analgesia and Professor of Anesthesiology at Columbia University, views the results as an important preliminary finding. “Reproducible findings are the cornerstone of scientific inquiry,” Dr. Shafer comments. “The authors have clearly described their methodology, and their findings. If other laboratories can reproduce these results in properly controlled studies, then this provides further support for the scientific basis of acupuncture. Additionally, the ability of quantitative sensory testing to identify specific types of nerves involved in pain transmission may help direct research into the mechanism of acupuncture analgesia.” \n Name * \n Email * \n Website \n  \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

Instead, it aims to treat the specific symptoms that are unique to each individual using a variety of of techniques such as acupuncture, tui-na massage, and energetic exercises to restore imbalances found in the body. Therefore, your diagnosis and treatment will depend on a number of variables including: \n Your answers to these questions will help your practitioner create a treatment plan specifically for you. The basic foundation for Oriental medicine is that there is a life energy flowing through the body which is termed Qi (pronounced chee). This energy flows through the body on channels known as meridians that connect all of our major organs.  According to Oriental medical theory, illness or pain arises when the cyclical flow of Qi in the meridians becomes unbalanced. Acupuncture stimulates specific points located on or near the surface of the skin to alter various biochemical and physiological conditions that cause aches and pains or illness. \n The length, number and frequency of treatments will vary. Typical treatments last from five to 30 minutes, with the patient being treated one or two times a week. Some headaches, migraines and related symptoms are relieved after the first treatment, while more severe or chronic ailments often require multiple treatments. \n Since the early seventies, studies around the globe have suggested that acupuncture is an effective treatment for migraines and headaches.  Researchers at Duke University Medical Center analyzed the results of more than 30 studies on acupuncture as a pain reliever for a variety of ailments, including chronic headaches.

The spleen plays a central part in the health and vitality of the body, taking a lead role in the assimilation of nutrients and maintenance of physical strength. It turns digested food from the stomach into usable nutrients and qi (energy). Many schools of thought have been formed around this organ; the premise being that the proper functioning of the”‘middle” is the key to all aspects of vitality. \n By taking into account a person’s constitution and varied symptoms, a treatment plan is designed specifically for the individual to bring their “middle” back into harmony and optimize the proper functioning of the digestive system. A variety of techniques can be used during treatment including acupuncture, lifestyle/dietary recommendations and energetic exercises to restore digestive health. \n Is your digestive system functioning as well as it could?

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Patients suffering TMJ (temporomandibular joint disorder) can find relief from acupuncture.  Research conducted at the Ribeirão Preto Dental School, São Paulo University in Brazil, found that after 3 months of acupuncture, patients with TMJ experienced significantly less pain, increased strength of their bite and decreased EMG activity of the masticatory muscles. \n Temporomandibular joint and muscle disorders (TMJ disorders) are problems or symptoms of the chewing muscles and joints that connect your lower jaw to your skull.  17 patients were studied using acupuncture points for TMJ.  EMG measures were acquired before and after the treatment. The data collected at rest, protrusion, left and right laterality, and clenching were normalized by maximum voluntary contraction. Maximal bite force in right and left molar regions were also measured. \n The researchers found decreased EMG activity at rest, protrusion, left and right laterality, and clenching; as well as increased values of maximal bite force after acupuncture treatment. \n The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine, 15 Issue 12: December 15, 2009 \n By: International Anesthesia Research Society (IARS) \n The scientific validity of traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of pain received a nod of support in the May issue of Anesthesia \u0026 Analgesia, official journal of the International Anesthesia Research Society (IARS). \n Dr. Philip Lang and colleagues of the University of Munich used quantitative sensory testing to identify changes in pain sensitivity with acupuncture in 24 healthy volunteers. After applying acupuncture to the leg, the researchers found that pain thresholds increased by up to 50 percent. Effects were noted in both the treated leg and the untreated (contralateral) leg. \n Quantitative sensory testing is used clinically to help physicians understand specific injuries in nerve fibers associated with chronic pain. It includes tests of both thermal perception (heat and cold), and mechanical perception (pressure applied to the skin). The patterns of response provide diagnostic information in patients with nerve injury regarding the type of nerve involved, and possible treatments. \n The results pointed to two nerve fibers—the “A delta” pain fibers and the “C” pain fibers—as being specifically affected by acupuncture. Although the effects were modest, the researchers believe they provide the basis for future studies in individuals with chronic pain, where the effects might be more dramatic. \n The study also supported the effects of three different forms of acupuncture: manual acupuncture needling alone and with the addition of high-frequency and low-frequency electrical stimulation. All treatments were performed by an experienced acupuncturist, applied to acupuncture points commonly used in pain management. \n The results provide a scientific background for the ancient practice of acupuncture, according to Dr. Dominik Irnich, Head of the Multidisciplinary Pain Centre, Department of Anesthesiology, University of Munich, and the study’s leading author. Additionally, Dr. Irnich notes, “Our results show that contralateral stimulation leads to a remarkable pain relief. This suggests that acupuncturists should needle contralaterally if the affected side is too painful or not accessible—for example, if the skin is injured or there is a dressing in place.” \n Dr. Steven L. Shafer, Editor-in-Chief of Anesthesia \u0026 Analgesia and Professor of Anesthesiology at Columbia University, views the results as an important preliminary finding. “Reproducible findings are the cornerstone of scientific inquiry,” Dr. Shafer comments. “The authors have clearly described their methodology, and their findings. If other laboratories can reproduce these results in properly controlled studies, then this provides further support for the scientific basis of acupuncture. Additionally, the ability of quantitative sensory testing to identify specific types of nerves involved in pain transmission may help direct research into the mechanism of acupuncture analgesia.” \n More than 45 million Americans (one in six) suffer from chronic headaches, 20 million of whom are women. Scientific research shows that acupuncture can be more effective than medication in reducing the severity and frequency of chronic headaches. \n The pain that headache and migraine sufferers endure can impact every aspect of their lives.  A widely accepted form of treatment for headaches, acupuncture can offer powerful relief without the side effects that prescription and over-the-counter drugs can cause. \n Headaches and migraines, as well as their underlying causes have been treated successfully with acupuncture and Oriental medicine for thousands of years.  Acupuncture and Oriental medicine can be used alone in the management and treatment of headaches, or as part of a comprehensive treatment program. \n Oriental Medicine does not recognize migraines and chronic headaches as one particular syndrome.

It turns digested food from the stomach into usable nutrients and qi (energy). Many schools of thought have been formed around this organ; the premise being that the proper functioning of the”‘middle” is the key to all aspects of vitality. \n By taking into account a person’s constitution and varied symptoms, a treatment plan is designed specifically for the individual to bring their “middle” back into harmony and optimize the proper functioning of the digestive system. A variety of techniques can be used during treatment including acupuncture, lifestyle/dietary recommendations and energetic exercises to restore digestive health. \n Is your digestive system functioning as well as it could? Acupuncture and Oriental medicine are extremely effective at treating a wide array of digestive disorders. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you. Together we implement lasting changes that will improve your energy, balance and health.

  "inline_text": "ENTRY \n ENTRY \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n オルガン針および、グループ企業を含めた統轄管理を行う部門です。会社の経営資源である、「ヒト・モノ・カネ・情報」を管理し、会社の成長を土台から支えています。部署によっては専門的な知識が求められるケースもありますが、ＯＪＴや研修を通じて、スキルの向上を図ります。 \n 入社年度：2015年 \n 入社年度：2015年 \n 入社年度：2015年 \n これまでの経歴と現在の仕事内容を教えてください。 \n 入社後は人事部門に配属となり、新入社員研修や階層別教育などの社内教育の企画・運営を担当しました。入社３年目に法務部門に異動し、現在は企業法務関連の業務を担当しています。主な内容は契約書の作成・チェック、稟議書等の社内決裁関連業務を行っています。仕事をする上で特に意識していることは、まず理解に徹することです。一旦契約書にサインすれば、そこに書かれている約束を果たす義務が会社に生じます。そのため、契約書について相談を受けたら、まずは依頼者の話をしっかりと聞き、取引の実情や経緯を理解した上で、内容が適切かどうかを検討するように心がけています。 \n どんなときに、やりがいを感じますか？ \n 「ありがとう」、「早く対応してもらえて助かったよ」など、感謝やねぎらいの言葉をかけてもらえたときが一番嬉しいです。また、会社にとって重要な意思決定をする際には何らかの形で法務が関わることが多いです。プレッシャーを感じることもありますが、会社組織全体の動きを知ることができるので、とても面白い仕事だと思います。 \n 当社に入社した理由、きっかけは何ですか？ \n 製品そのものだけでなく、製品を加工するための設備もほとんどを自社で製作しているという点に興味を持ちました。元々ものづくりに興味があったこともあり、自社の技術・ノウハウをベースに製品の開発・生産・販売を手がける会社の姿勢に共感して、入社を決めました。 \n 会社の雰囲気を教えてください。 \n 面倒見がよくて温かい人が多い会社、という印象です。採用選考や新入社員研修でお世話になった役員・先輩社員の方と廊下ですれ違った時に「これからよろしくね。」「仕事は慣れてきた？」と声をかけていただき、とても嬉しかったことを覚えています。 \n 学生の皆さんへメッセージをお願いします。 \n 当社には様々な経歴やスキルを持った社員が多く在籍しています。そのため、人との関わり合いを通じて入社後も成長していきたいと考える人には魅力的な会社だと思います。自分の価値観にマッチする会社で、皆さんが充実した社会人生活を送れることを願っています。がんばってください。 \n ※インタビュー内容は取材時のものです（2018年3月取材）  \n 入社年度：2015年 \n 現在の仕事内容を教えてください。 \n 開発部門の社員の勤怠管理、来客対応、伝票処理のほか、部品の加工プログラムを製作する業務もあり、メリハリをつけて業務を行っています。また、勤怠管理のように社員の給与に関わるような業務は、常に緊張感を持って、間違えのないように確認することを強く意識しています。 \n どんなときに、やりがいを感じますか？ \n 勤怠管理や伝票管理はお金に関わることなので、責任はありますがその分やりがいも感じています。またそのほかの日常業務は、どのような工夫をしたらミスなく効率よく行えるかを考えながら、業務に携わっています。その結果が、時間短縮などの目標の達成につながると、更にモチベーションが上がります。 \n 当社に入社した理由、きっかけは何ですか？ \n ミシン針を使って作られた製品は身近にたくさんありますが、ミシン針のメーカーが珍しいことから、興味を持ちました。あの小さなミシン針がたくさんの工程を経て作られていることや、社員のみなさんが、自社製品に強い誇りとこだわりをもっているところも魅力で、入社を決めました。 \n 会社の雰囲気を教えてください。 \n わからないことや些細なことも、質問や相談がしやすい会社だと思います。部署や世代を問わず、仕事はもちろん、それ以外のことも、気にかけてくださる人が多いと感じています。 \n 学生の皆さんへメッセージをお願いします。 \n 当社では、学生時代の専攻にとらわれず、多くの方が活躍されています。これまでの経験から活かせることもたくさんあると思いますので、幅広く色々なことに挑戦し続けてください。 \n ※インタビュー内容は取材時のものです（2018年9月取材） \n  \n 開発部門Development \n 営業部門Sales \n 管理部門Managing \n 採用に関するお問い合わせは下記フォームよりお問い合わせください \n © ORGAN ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.\n\t\t一本の針に心を込めて、世界の顧客に手渡そう\n\t \n \n\t\t\n\t \n 採用TOP \n 会社を知る\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t会社を知る\n\t\t\t\t\t会社紹介\n\t\t\t\t\t\tオルガン針の魅力\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n オルガンらしさを知る\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tオルガンらしさを知る\n\t\t\t\t\t教育制度\n\t\t\t\t\t\t福利厚生\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n 仕事を知る\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t仕事を知る\n\t\t\t\t\t開発部門\n\t\t\t\t\t\t営業部門\n\t\t\t\t\t\t管理部門\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n 募集要項 \n Q\u0026A \n \n\t\t一本の針に心を込めて、世界の顧客に手渡そう\n\t \n \n\t\t\n\t \n 採用TOP \n 会社を知る\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n オルガンらしさを知る\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n 仕事を知る\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n 募集要項 \n Q\u0026A \n \n\t\t一本の針に心を込めて、世界の顧客に手渡そう\n\t \n \n\t\t\n\t \n 本サイトへ戻る \n TOP \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t会社を知る\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t会社を知る\n\t\t\t\t\t会社案内\n\t\t\t\t\tオルガン針の魅力\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tオルガンらしさを知る\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tオルガンらしさを知る\n\t\t\t\t\t教育制度\n\t\t\t\t\t福利厚生制度\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t仕事を知る\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t開発部門\n\t\t\t\t\t営業部門\n\t\t\t\t\t管理部門\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n  \n 募集要項 \n Q\u0026A \n エントリー \n 開発部門 \n 営業部門 \n 管理部門 \n \n管理部門 vol.1入社年度：2015年\n \n \n管理部門 vol.2入社年度：2015年\n \n 開発部門 \n 営業部門 \n 管理部門 \n \n\t\t\t開発部門Development\n\t\t \n \n\t\t\t営業部門Sales\n\t\t \n \n\t\t\t管理部門Managing\n\t\t \n 採用に関するお問い合わせ \n エントリーする",
