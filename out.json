  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n For most cultures across the globe, there are beauty constants such as clear skin, bright eyes, and shiny hair. Like calmness and strength, these outward features are universally attractive. While we work towards these qualities with regimens that may include exercise, meditation, or even using a nice shampoo, the foods we eat are key to achieving inner and outer beauty. \n In traditional Chinese medicine, foods are prescribed for their effects on organs, blood, yin, yang, and Qi, the major players in our physical and emotional health. Foods such as rice, seaweed, sweet potatoes, and bananas nourish our yin, which in turn hydrates and nourishes organs. Think of a parched plant; after a good watering it becomes more tumescent. Eating yin-enhancing foods nourishes the body in a way that simple drinking water cannot. \n Sweet black rice, when cooked with longan berries (euphoria longana) and Chinese dates, becomes a congee that nourishes blood and Qi. In the Chinese system of food cures, these three foods work together to enhance beauty and longevity. \n Sweet Rice Congee (Taken from Ancient Healing for Modern Women, by Dr. Xiolan Zhao, C.M.D.) \n Ingredients: \n   \n Instructions: \n In a large heavy saucepan, add 6 cups of water, black sweet rice, longan fruit, dates, and raw sugar. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat and simmer for two hours, stirring occasionally. Garnish with ginger. Makes four servings.\nNote: All ingredients are available at most Asian grocery stores. \n  \n Adding nutrient-rich super foods to the diet can give men a healthy boost. \n Here are just a few foods that can help maintain muscle mass, prevent prostate cancer, and more. \n Avocados\nAvocados are a good source of vitamin K, dietary fiber, vitamin B6, vitamin C, folate and copper.  Rich in potassium, avocados contain more of this nutrient than bananas.  Potassium is needed to regulate nerves, heartbeat and, especially, blood pressure.  An added bonus for men: Avocados inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells. \n Blackberries\nBlackberries are packed with Vitamin C, calcium and magnesium, with more than double the amounts than their popular cousin, the blueberry.  Vitamin C is a powerful stress reducer that can lower blood pressure and return cortisol levels to normal faster when taken during periods of stress.  Magnesium and calcium act together to help regulate the nerves and muscle tone. \n Too little magnesium in your diet can cause nerve cells to become over activated and can trigger muscular tension, soreness, spasms, cramps, and fatigue.  Blackberries also score high on the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) scale assesses the antioxidant content of food: the higher the score, the better the food’s ability to neutralize cell-damaging free radicals that lead to cancer. \n Spinach\nSpinach is one of the most nutrient-dense foods in existence.  Spinach can help protect against prostate cancer, reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke, lower blood pressure and strengthen muscles. \n Walnuts\nWhen it comes to their health benefits, walnuts are the king of nuts. Richer in heart-healthy omega-3s than salmon, loaded with more anti-oxidants than red wine, and packing half as much muscle-building protein as chicken, walnuts are one of the all time super foods. \n Yogurt\nEating yogurt that contains live bacterial cultures every day improves digestive health, boosts the immune system, provides protection against cancer and may help you live longer.   Not all yogurts are probiotic though, so make sure the label says “live and active cultures.” \n Let us custom-tailor a treatment plan that will best suit your individual needs so that you can feel better quickly and safely! \n  \n Acupuncture views nutrition in a complex light, through the application of Oriental medicine wisdom to dietary habits. In short, certain foods are considered too yang, or hot to eat in excess during the warmer months, while others are prized for their yin ability to cool the body. Overall, the goal is balance between the internal yin and yang of the body. \n A healthy, nutritional diet, good sleep and moderate exercise can keep your skin and physical form at its best. \n For healthy skin, be sure to integrate these foods into your diet: \n Carrots and Sweet Potatoes: \n Healthy skin is directly dependent on the amount of vitamin A in our diet. Vitamin A acts as an antioxidant to neutralize harmful elements in our skin, helping to prevent wrinkles, resist infection and maintain the skin’s elasticity. Some of the best sources of Vitamin A are vegetables that are deep orange in color. \n Blackberries, Blueberries, Strawberries, and Plums:  \n In a study recently published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, these four fruits weighed in with the highest “total antioxidant capacity” of any food.  The antioxidants and other phytochemicals in these fruits can protect cells from damage and disintegration, thus guarding against premature aging. \n Salmon, Walnuts, Olive Oil, and Flax Seed:  \n Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are responsible for skin repair, moisture content, and overall elasticity, but because the body cannot produce its own EFAs, they must be obtained through the diet. Fish, walnuts, and flax seed oil are among the best sources for omega 3 fatty acids. Eating good-quality olive oil helps keep skin lubricated and keeps it looking and feeling healthier overall. Which olive oils are the best for your skin? Those labeled “cold pressed,” “expeller processed,” or “extra virgin” are the least processed forms. As a result, they contain the highest levels of antioxidant substances. \n Whole Wheat Bread, Brown Rice, Turkey, Tuna and Brazil Nuts:  \n Selenium is an antioxidant mineral responsible for tissue elasticity and healthy skin. It may also play an important role in preventing skin cancer, as some recent studies are showing that skin damaged by the sun may suffer fewer consequences if selenium levels are high. \n Green Tea:  \n Green tea’s ability to slow down the development of some signs of aging is attributed to its high levels of polyphenols, which have been well-documented for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Green tea may help prevent or reduce the risk of skin cancer according to a study published recently in the Archives of Dermatology, which shows that whether taken orally or applied to the skin, green tea can reduce the risk of damage from ultraviolet light and thus reduce the risk of skin cancer. \n Water : \n  Hydration plays a key role in keeping skin cells healthy. It is essential to maintaining your skin’s elasticity and suppleness. Keeping cells hydrated helps cells move nutrients in and toxins out, which helps keep skin clean and clear. \n Let us help you to optimize your skin health! \n Acupuncture and Oriental medicine can be very effective at treating skin conditions. Treatments can provide quick relief for acute symptoms and significant and lasting relief from recurrent or chronic skin conditions. \n The skin reflects and reacts to imbalances within the body’s internal landscape and the effects of the environment. Internal disharmonies caused by strong emotions, diet, and your constitution, as well as environmental influences such as wind, dryness, dampness, and heat, can all contribute to the development of a skin disorder. To keep your skin healthy and beautiful on the outside, you must work on the inside of your body as well. Increasing the flow of energy, blood and lymph circulation improves the skin’s natural healthy color. \n Promotion of collagen production increases muscle tone and elasticity, helping to firm the skin. Stimulating the formation of body fluids nourishes the skin and encourages it to be moister, softer, smoother and more lustrous. \n General skin conditions that can be treated with acupuncture and Oriental medicine include acne, dermatitis, eczema, pruritus, psoriasis, rosacea, shingles and urticaria (hives). Oriental medicine does not recognize skin problems as one particular syndrome. Instead, it aims to treat the specific symptoms that are unique to each individual using a variety of techniques with acupuncture, such as herbal medicine, bodywork, lifestyle/dietary recommendations and energetic exercises to restore imbalances found in the body. Therefore, if 10 patients are treated with Oriental medicine for eczema, each patient will receive a unique, customized treatment with different lifestyle and dietary recommendations. \n If you suffer from a skin condition or would like to know how to optimize your skin health, Contact One Essence Healing to learn more about how acupuncture and Oriental medicine can help you. \n More than 95 million Americans suffer from digestive disorders ranging from constipation, diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome to more serious conditions such as acid reflux (GERD), ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. In fact, more than 35 million physician office visits a year are due to gastrointestinal complaints. Reports are confirming that acupuncture and Oriental medicine can offer relief from even the most complex digestive problems. \n Evidence that Oriental medicine has been used for digestive disorders can be found in early medical literature dating back to 3 AD, where specific acupuncture points and herbal formulas for borborygmus (rumbling or gurgling in the intestines), abdominal pain and diarrhea with pain are discussed. \n According to Oriental medical theory, most digestive disorders are due to disharmony in the spleen and stomach. The spleen plays a central part in the health and vitality of the body, taking a lead role in the assimilation of nutrients and maintenance of physical strength. It turns digested food from the stomach into usable nutrients and qi (energy). Many schools of thought have been formed around this organ; the premise being that the proper functioning of the”‘middle” is the key to all aspects of vitality. \n By taking into account a person’s constitution and varied symptoms, a treatment plan is designed specifically for the individual to bring their “middle” back into harmony and optimize the proper functioning of the digestive system. A variety of techniques can be used during treatment including acupuncture, lifestyle/dietary recommendations and energetic exercises to restore digestive health. \n Is your digestive system functioning as well as it could? Acupuncture and Oriental medicine are extremely effective at treating a wide array of digestive disorders. Contact us today to learn more about how acupuncture and Oriental medicine can be integrated into your digestive wellness plan! \n Repetitive stress injuries (RSI) are the most common job-related injuries and are responsible for the highest number of days lost among all work related injuries. One of the most well-known types of repetitive stress injury, carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) accounts for over two million visits to physicians’ offices and approximately 465,000 carpal tunnel release operations each year, making it the most frequent surgery of the hand and wrist. \n Symptoms of repetitive stress injuries include tightness, stiffness, pain, tingling, numbness, coldness and loss of strength in the arm. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a repetitive stress injury that refers specifically to the inflammation of a specific ligament that puts pressure on the median nerve. \n Acupuncture is extremely effective for treating repetitive stress injuries including carpal tunnel syndrome; eliminating the need for surgery or the use of anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids. In fact, one of the most common reasons that people get acupuncture is for repetitive stress injuries. Recent studies even suggest that acupuncture may be more effective than corticosteroids when it comes to treating CTS. \n The carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway in the wrist made up of ligaments and bones. The median nerve and the tendons that connect the fingers to the muscles of the forearm pass through this tightly spaced tunnel. \n Carpal tunnel syndrome, also known as median nerve entrapment, occurs when swelling or irritation of the tendons in the carpal tunnel results in pressure on the median nerve causing pain in the palm side of the wrist and pain and tingling in the fingers. The median nerve controls sensations to the palm side of the thumb and fingers, as well as impulses to some small muscles in the hand that allow the fingers and thumb to move. \n Symptoms usually start gradually, with frequent burning, tingling, or numbness in the palm of the hand and the fingers, especially the index, middle and ring fingers. Pain can sometimes travel up the arm and affect the shoulder. The symptoms often first appear during the night. As symptoms worsen, people might feel pain, weakness, or numbness in the hand and wrist, radiating up the arm during the day. Decreased grip strength may make it difficult to form a fist, grasp small objects, or perform other manual tasks. If not properly treated, CTS can cause irreversible nerve damage and permanent deterioration of muscle tissue. \n From an Oriental medicine perspective, a repetitive stress injury is seen as a disruption of the flow of Qi and Blood (Xue) within the area and associated with cold, dampness or wind penetrating the muscles and sinews. Acupuncture points, stretching exercises, herbal remedies and nutritional supplements are chosen to treat accordingly. \n In addition to reducing the swelling, inflammation and pain, acupuncture addresses any headaches, neck pain, shoulder stiffness and sleeping problems that often accompany this condition. Your treatment may also take into account any underlying conditions that contribute to the development of RSI including posture, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid problems, diabetes, and hormonal changes of pregnancy and menopause. \n Managing repetitive stress injuries often requires some lifestyle changes, and it can take time to work out a strategy that works best for you. \n Here are a few minor changes you can implement to minimize stress on your hands and wrists: \n Shoulders and neck should be relaxed to open the chest and allow your head to float upwards without strain. When using a keyboard, wrists should be in a relaxed middle position and in a straight line with your forearms at elbow height or slightly lower.\nIf you or someone you know suffers from a repetitive stress injury, Call us today to learn more about how acupuncture and Oriental medicine can help you. \n Our society puts a premium on our waking hours and has the tendency to underestimate the importance of a full-night’s sleep. Often, good sleep hygiene is an afterthought for many people. Millions of people are besieged with insomnia and look for quick fixes instead of exploring the root causes of the problem. \n Evening is a time to allow our minds and bodies to turn inward to our subconscious. Excessive lighting at night, evening shift work, evening computing, video games, television and late-night eating all serve to counteract the body’s natural rhythms. It’s no wonder people have trouble sleeping. Exposure to early morning light and dusk helps to regulate sleep hormones in the body. Rather than embrace nighttime we tend to let our minds wander from one element of stress to another keeping us up for hours or perhaps an entire evening. We are then forced to approach the new day without having benefited from the regenerative powers that night time brings. \n In Oriental medicine sleep occurs when the yang energy of the day folds into Yin – nighttime. Yin energy of the body is cooling and restorative. It is the time of day when our bodies turn inward and regenerate. This is the time we dream and explore the caverns of our unconscious mind. Conversely, daytime is yang, which is expansive. We expend the energy we have built up from the process of sleeping. Together, this is the cycle of yin and yang. \n To apply the concept of yin and yang to your everyday life try eating your last meal at least three hours before going to bed. If you are a hot excess type, you can cool your body down by avoiding hot and spicy food and drink. Avoid alcohol, coffee, chocolate any other stimulants, especially late in the day. \n Help circulate your body’s energy by working out or by gentle exercising. Build your body’s nutritive aspect by eating marrow based soups and stews, dark pigmented vegetables and fruits. Avoid overworking or over rumination as well. \n Meditation is an invaluable tool to help your brain unwind. Helping the body create a sense of calm meditation can reduce stress, increase feelings of well-being, and improve overall health. It is of specific use to help one increase alertness, relaxation and reflection even in “waking” states. Meditation is best practiced during the day to help ease your sleep patterns at night. \n One contributor to insomnia, stress, weakens the function of the liver, which in turn affects the health of your nerves. Acupuncture and Oriental medicine have a calming effect on the nervous system clearing obstructions in the muscle and nerve channels, assisting the flow of oxygen-enriched energy and relaxing the system. Common noted benefits include deeper breathing, improved digestive abilities, better sleeping patterns, and a general sense of well being. \n Practicing good sleep hygiene and keeping your body in sync with the rhythm of day and night can help your body cope with sleep deprivation give it an opportunity to get stronger and heal. \n By implementing just a few of the following suggestions you should notice a great improvement in your sleep and how you function in the daylight hours. \n   \n Patients suffering TMJ (temporomandibular joint disorder) can find relief from acupuncture.  Research conducted at the Ribeirão Preto Dental School, São Paulo University in Brazil, found that after 3 months of acupuncture, patients with TMJ experienced significantly less pain, increased strength of their bite and decreased EMG activity of the masticatory muscles. \n Temporomandibular joint and muscle disorders (TMJ disorders) are problems or symptoms of the chewing muscles and joints that connect your lower jaw to your skull.  17 patients were studied using acupuncture points for TMJ.  EMG measures were acquired before and after the treatment. The data collected at rest, protrusion, left and right laterality, and clenching were normalized by maximum voluntary contraction. Maximal bite force in right and left molar regions were also measured. \n The researchers found decreased EMG activity at rest, protrusion, left and right laterality, and clenching; as well as increased values of maximal bite force after acupuncture treatment. \n The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine, 15 Issue 12: December 15, 2009 \n By: International Anesthesia Research Society (IARS) \n The scientific validity of traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of pain received a nod of support in the May issue of Anesthesia \u0026 Analgesia, official journal of the International Anesthesia Research Society (IARS). \n Dr. Philip Lang and colleagues of the University of Munich used quantitative sensory testing to identify changes in pain sensitivity with acupuncture in 24 healthy volunteers. After applying acupuncture to the leg, the researchers found that pain thresholds increased by up to 50 percent. Effects were noted in both the treated leg and the untreated (contralateral) leg. \n Quantitative sensory testing is used clinically to help physicians understand specific injuries in nerve fibers associated with chronic pain. It includes tests of both thermal perception (heat and cold), and mechanical perception (pressure applied to the skin). The patterns of response provide diagnostic information in patients with nerve injury regarding the type of nerve involved, and possible treatments. \n The results pointed to two nerve fibers—the “A delta” pain fibers and the “C” pain fibers—as being specifically affected by acupuncture. Although the effects were modest, the researchers believe they provide the basis for future studies in individuals with chronic pain, where the effects might be more dramatic. \n The study also supported the effects of three different forms of acupuncture: manual acupuncture needling alone and with the addition of high-frequency and low-frequency electrical stimulation. All treatments were performed by an experienced acupuncturist, applied to acupuncture points commonly used in pain management. \n The results provide a scientific background for the ancient practice of acupuncture, according to Dr. Dominik Irnich, Head of the Multidisciplinary Pain Centre, Department of Anesthesiology, University of Munich, and the study’s leading author. Additionally, Dr. Irnich notes, “Our results show that contralateral stimulation leads to a remarkable pain relief. This suggests that acupuncturists should needle contralaterally if the affected side is too painful or not accessible—for example, if the skin is injured or there is a dressing in place.” \n Dr. Steven L. Shafer, Editor-in-Chief of Anesthesia \u0026 Analgesia and Professor of Anesthesiology at Columbia University, views the results as an important preliminary finding. “Reproducible findings are the cornerstone of scientific inquiry,” Dr. Shafer comments. “The authors have clearly described their methodology, and their findings. If other laboratories can reproduce these results in properly controlled studies, then this provides further support for the scientific basis of acupuncture. Additionally, the ability of quantitative sensory testing to identify specific types of nerves involved in pain transmission may help direct research into the mechanism of acupuncture analgesia.” \n More than 45 million Americans (one in six) suffer from chronic headaches, 20 million of whom are women. Scientific research shows that acupuncture can be more effective than medication in reducing the severity and frequency of chronic headaches. \n The pain that headache and migraine sufferers endure can impact every aspect of their lives.  A widely accepted form of treatment for headaches, acupuncture can offer powerful relief without the side effects that prescription and over-the-counter drugs can cause. \n Headaches and migraines, as well as their underlying causes have been treated successfully with acupuncture and Oriental medicine for thousands of years.  Acupuncture and Oriental medicine can be used alone in the management and treatment of headaches, or as part of a comprehensive treatment program. \n Oriental Medicine does not recognize migraines and chronic headaches as one particular syndrome. Instead, it aims to treat the specific symptoms that are unique to each individual using a variety of of techniques such as acupuncture, tui-na massage, and energetic exercises to restore imbalances found in the body. Therefore, your diagnosis and treatment will depend on a number of variables including: \n Your answers to these questions will help your practitioner create a treatment plan specifically for you. The basic foundation for Oriental medicine is that there is a life energy flowing through the body which is termed Qi (pronounced chee). This energy flows through the body on channels known as meridians that connect all of our major organs.  According to Oriental medical theory, illness or pain arises when the cyclical flow of Qi in the meridians becomes unbalanced. Acupuncture stimulates specific points located on or near the surface of the skin to alter various biochemical and physiological conditions that cause aches and pains or illness. \n The length, number and frequency of treatments will vary. Typical treatments last from five to 30 minutes, with the patient being treated one or two times a week. Some headaches, migraines and related symptoms are relieved after the first treatment, while more severe or chronic ailments often require multiple treatments. \n Since the early seventies, studies around the globe have suggested that acupuncture is an effective treatment for migraines and headaches.  Researchers at Duke University Medical Center analyzed the results of more than 30 studies on acupuncture as a pain reliever for a variety of ailments, including chronic headaches. They found that acupuncture decreases pain with fewer side effects and can be less expensive than medication.  Researchers found that using acupuncture as an alternative for pain relief also reduced the need for post-operative pain medications. \n In a study published in the November 1999 issue of Cephalalgia, scientists evaluated the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of migraines and recurrent headaches by systematically reviewing 22 randomized controlled trials. A total of 1,042 patients were examined. It was found that headache and migraine sufferers experienced significantly more relief from acupuncture than patients who were administered “sham” acupuncture. \n A clinical observation, published in a 2002 edition of the Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine, studied 50 patients presenting with various types of headaches who were treated with scalp acupuncture. The results of this study showed that 98 percent of patients treated with scalp acupuncture experienced no headaches or only occasional, mild headaches in the six months following care. \n In a case study, published in the June 2003 Issue of Medical Acupuncture, doctors found that acupuncture resulted in the resolution or reduction in the frequency and severity of cluster headaches, and a decrease or discontinuation of pain medications. It was concluded that acupuncture can be used to provide sustained relief from cluster headaches and to stimulate the body’s natural production of adrenal cortisol to aid in discontinuing corticosteroids. \n According to the July 2005 issue of the British Medical Journal, a randomized controlled trial in Germany found that acupuncture cut tension headache rates almost in half.  Researchers divided 270 patients who reported similarly severe tension headaches into three groups for the study. Over the project’s eight-week period, one group received traditional acupuncture, one received only minimal acupuncture, and the third group received neither treatment. Those receiving the traditional acupuncture reported headache rates of nearly half that of those who received no treatments, suffering 7 fewer days of headaches. The minimal acupuncture group suffered 6.6 fewer days, and the non-acupuncture group suffered 1.5 fewer days.  The improvements continued for months after the treatments were concluded, rising slightly as time went on. \n Do you or someone you know suffer from headaches or migraines? \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

From a Western perspective, we know that longans contain large amounts of Vitamin C and phenolic compounds, which may help to detoxify and protect the liver. \n Alternate Tasks – Avoid doing the same task for more than a couple of hours at a time and alternate between tasks that use different muscle groups where possible. Fatigue is a sign that you need to take a break. Take small breaks to gently stretch and bend your hands and wrists and readjust your position. \n Reduce Pressure – Many people use more force than needed to perform tasks involving their hands, which can increase pressure and cause irritation. Be mindful of the speed and amount of pressure used to perform tasks. Ease up, slow down, and grip using your palm or whole hand to distribute the load. If using tools such as riveters or jackhammers for extended periods, take frequent breaks or operate the tool at a speed that causes the least amount of vibration. \n Cultivate Good Posture – Incorrect posture can cause your shoulders to roll forward, shortening neck and shoulder muscles and compressing nerves in your neck, which can affect your wrists, hands, and fingers. \n Maintain a routine sleep schedule. \n Make your bedroom a sanctuary. \n Keep it dark, cool, and quiet. \n Establish a sense of safety with your surroundings. \n Reduce nicotine, caffeine and alcohol use. \n Avoid rigorous exercise 3-5 hours prior to bedtime. \n Avoid heavy meals near bedtime. \n Position clock away from the bed. \n Limit television and computer use to early evening. \n Is the headache behind your eyes and temples, or is it located more on the top of your head? \n When do your headaches occur (i.e. night, morning, after eating)? \n Do you find that a cold compress or a darkened room can alleviate some of the pain? \n Is the pain dull and throbbing, or sharp and piercing?",

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n I practice a holistic approach to health and wellness, which means that I look at how all areas of your life are connected. Does stress at your job or in your relationship cause you to overeat? Does lack of sleep or low energy prevent you from exercising? As we work together, we will look at how all parts of your life affect your health as a whole. \n My approach is not to dwell on calories, carbs, fats, and proteins. It is not to create lists of restrictions or good and bad foods. Instead, I work with my clients to create a happy, healthy life in a way that is flexible, fun and rewarding. \n Together we’ll work to reach your health goals in areas such as achieving optimal weight, reducing food cravings, increasing sleep, and maximizing energy. As we work together, you’ll develop a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you and implement lasting changes that will improve your energy, balance and health. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Acupuncture, or “needle therapy” (zhenjiu) as it is called in Chinese, is an ancient form of medicine which is gaining more and more popularity in this country for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. \n During a treatment, very thin, solid, hairlike needles are inserted at specific points on the body. In Chinese these points are called “neural nodes” (jie) and the stimulation of these nodes affects both the central and peripheral nervous systems. It triggers the release of the body’s internal chemicals such as endorphins and enkephalins, which have pain-relieving properties. If you have pain that is lingering or is not being treated by other modalities, then acupuncture offers a time-tested, very reliable method of pain relief. \n During a treatment, very thin, solid, hairlike needles are inserted at specific points on the body.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n “Offering emotional freedom from stress, anxiety, panic depression, anger,trauma,PTSD, abuse, addictions,chronic pain, relationship issues and more.” \n Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) is a highly effective self-help tool used in my coaching. It was first developed by Dr. Roger Callahan at Stanford University in the 1980s but it’s roots go back 3000 years to ancient Chinese medicine. It has been proven effective in enhancing the ability to change behavior patterns, overcome negative beliefs, and eliminate stress. Finger tapping on the face and upper body’s acupressure points in a consistent manner while thinking about a past painful events dissipates the related negative emotions. The resulting feelings of calm and release are in actuality altering brain function (as seen on digital brain scans during treatment). EFT is akin to acupressure for the emotions. It is said that 1 hour of EFT is equivalent to 100 hours of traditional talk therapy. \n EFT is gaining mass acceptance as research becomes widely published. The EFT instructional manual has been translated in over 20 languages and has been downloaded by over 1 million people around the world. Although relatively unknown amongst traditional allopathic practitioners in the United States, EFT is being used routinely in children’s cancer hospital wards in Mexico as well as by the Israeli military for treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder. Several Phoenix area professional sports teams contract EFT practitioners for peak performance training. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n www.naet.com \n NAET was created in the 1980s by Dr. Devi Nambudripad. She suffered with many food, environmental and chemical allergies her whole life. She was so ill in her 20s that she could only eat broccoli and rice. At the time she was studying Chinese medicine in graduate school and had come home one day after receiving an acupuncture treatment. As she was cooking her rice, she decided to try a bite of a carrot, and immediately passed out on the kitchen floor. Coming to, she felt fantastic! She discovered that if you combine acupuncture stimulation (or acupressure without needles) with exposure to a specific allergen after a period of avoidance, you can eliminate that allergy! The actual technique has of course been refined since then. \n How it works is you hold a specific allergen in your hand and we use muscle response testing to determine if your body has a weakness, or allergy, to that item. If you do, we treat it. The treatment consists of gentle palpation down your spine as you hold onto the allergen. We re-test the item then and it should be “strong.” In other words, we stimulate your nervous system – kind of like re-booting a computer – to change its response to the allergen. Instead of your body having an allergic, or “fight-or-flight” reaction to the substance, your body can have a “normal” response. \n We have found NAET to be beneficial in treating pollen allergies, anaphylactic allergies, and mild food allergies. \n NAET stands for Nambudripad’s Allergy Elimination Technique, developed by Dr. Devi S. Nambudripad, a pioneer of this practice. NAET is a combination of methods that uses most of what is already known from allopathic medical knowledge, chiropractic, kinesiology, acupuncture and nutrition. NAET is a non-invasive, drug free, natural solution that eliminates allergies of all types. It helps shift mental, emotional and physical imbalances. \n From a holistic perspective, based on Oriental medical principles, allergy is a condition of unusual sensitivity of a person to one or more substances that may be harmless to the majority of individuals. In the allergic person, the allergic substance is viewed by the brain as a threat to the body’s well being. Allergies are the result of energy imbalances in the body, leading to a diminished state of health in one or more organ systems. \n According to the NAET perspective, allergies include:\n \n The allergy test is done by way of muscle testing (kinesiology). An energy vial of the substance is placed in your hand while you are muscle tested. A weak reaction will indicate that this substance needs to be treated through Acupressure and Acupuncture. On following appointment, the first allergen will be retested and strengthened if necessary. Afterwards the next item on the NAET Basic protocol is checked and, if found weak, it will be treated. NAET Protocol will be strictly followed. The purpose of this process is to improve a person’s immune system. There are 15 to 20 items in the basic protocol that can be tested. \n By clearing foods from the basic protocol, we strengthen the immune system, improve digestion and absorption. This allows the body to get the necessary nutrients, which are essential for life. \n Anyone who suffers from allergies can benefit from NAET Treatment at any age no matter how long they have suffered from allergy symptoms. \n One allergen is cleared per visit. Each individual has a different genetic makeup and health history so the number of sessions required varies from one individual to another. For some people allergens are cleared immediately, however, for others it may take many sessions to accomplish the desired results. \n Can Allergies cause real illness? \n Allergies can definitely cause illness. Continuous contact with an allergen produces toxins in the body, and causes blockages in the meridians. If these blockages are not cleared, reactions to the allergens often produce symptoms that mimic other diseases. \n How do I know if NAET is right for me? \n To know more about NAET and how it helps to remove allergies, we suggest that you read the book entitled, “Say Goodbye to Illness” by Dr. Devi Nambudripad. You may order the book from our office or from any bookstore. After reading it, you can decide if you think it is appropriate for you. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you. Together we implement lasting changes that will improve your energy, balance and health.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Acupressure is a branch of Traditional Chinese Medicine which involves the stimulation of acupuncture points with finger pressure using the power and sensitivity of human touch, rather than inserting needles. This form of healing is non-invasive and gentle. The indications include the vast array of conditions that Chinese medicine has proven to treat effectively. Because acupressure stimulates the body’s natural self-healing abilities, it also works as a great preventative therapy. Generally, the effects of acupressure are less potent than those of acupuncture, and as a result more treatments are needed to get the same results. \n Acupressure is ideal for children. It is gentle, safe, and effective for many conditions, including relief and prevention of colds and flu. Parents can also be taught self-help techniques to use on their child at home. \n Acupressure is also suitable for the elderly suffering from conditions including arthritis, mobility problems, constipation, and poor circulation. \n Certain acupressure points must be avoided during pregnancy. Be sure to tell your practitioner if you are or may be pregnant. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you. Together we implement lasting changes that will improve your energy, balance and health.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n In addition to acupuncture and herbology, cupping therapy has been part of Chinese medicine for over 2,500 years. Originally, animal horn was used for cupping, later on brass, ceramic, and bamboo cups were used. Today, we use glass cups in a variety of different sizes. \n Cupping is like a very deep tissue massage. The practitioner applies heat in a cup and then applies that cup to the body, most commonly on the back. The heat creates a vacuum effect and draws the skin up into the cup. The result is a movement of fresh blood to the area, release of toxins, acupuncture point stimulation, increased circulation of blood and lymph, relaxation of tight muscles, and reduced inflammation. \n Cupping does leave noticeable marks similar to a bruise or hickey that is sometimes referred to as “cup kisses”. Although they can look alarming, they are not painful and will disappear on their own within 3-7 days. \n Most commonly, cupping is used for aches and pains of various types including low back and leg pain, neck and shoulder tension, and fibromyalgia. It also helps open up the chest and benefits the lungs to treat respiratory problems such as cough, bronchitis, asthma, and the like. It can even benefit menstrual problems and digestive problems including stomach aches, vomiting, and diarrhea. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you. Together we implement lasting changes that will improve your energy, balance and health.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n The spiritual side of acupuncture \n Most people think Esoteric Acupuncture is merely another form of acupuncture treatment. Practitioners may be interested in which acupuncture points to use and how to sequence the needling of those acupuncture sites. Those who are newly introduced to Esoteric Acupuncture may be impressed with the various geometric patterns. Esoteric Acupuncture defines a “way of life.” \n Esoteric Acupuncture is not merely another form of acupuncture treatment. Esoteric Acupuncture defines a “way of life.” This way of life emphasizes the awakening and expansion of our spiritual center (not the same as religions). This way of life includes the importance of understanding the vibrational frequencies of the foods and drinks we ingest. Everything we eat and drink shapes our multiple energy fields. It is important to only ingest foods of the cleanest and highest vibrations. Energy is transported through our hands, fingers and mind through the acupuncture needle into the client. Energy is a transporter of information. What information are you transmitting to your client? \n The phrase Esoteric Acupuncture is broken up into three sections. Esoteric means something that is not readily known. There may be other meanings not understood by the casual reader or those not versed in esoteric teachings. Acupuncture comes from two words. “Acus” is a Latin word that means needle or obelisk. In esoteric teachings, obelisk can also mean a temple. Puncture means to pierce. Therefore, we are piercing your “temple” (your physical body) to activate or to reach something esoteric within. This esoteric “something” is the alignment, strengthening and refining your Heart Center. This Heart Center is the field that opens up infinite possibilities for your journey on planet Earth. We are interested in raising the vibrations of your Heart Center and to connect this center with all your denser frequency fields of consciousness including: your dense physical, etheric, astral and mental fields, plus accessing and activating the buddhic, atmic, monadic and logoic fields of cosnciousness. It is possible for some of you to access solar, galactic and cosmic consciousness with repeated Esoteric Acupuncture treatments. \n There was an inherent Time-lock in the release of Esoteric Acupuncture to Humanity. (Esoteric Acupuncture had its present genesis in 1995, but was not introduce to the public in book format until 1999.) That Time-lock was that the Consciousness of Humanity had to be vibrating at a higher frequency in order to be able to accept and understand the Ageless Wisdom in this New Format. It is important that you be able to quiet the mind to strengthen your Higher Heart Center. Academia is one of the most stubborn institutions for allowing changes to occur. Only those vibrating at a certain frequency will be drawn to Esoteric Acupuncture. Moving away from tradition is not something a society or group will easily accept. \n Externalization of the Hierarchy \n ” A New Humanity is developing with a New and Finer Frequency Pulse for this planet. Are you flowing with the New Pulse or are you stagnant in the Old Frequencies? There will not be one external savior to assist with humanities karma. It will be a group body of dedicated individuals who will, as a group, raise the light quotient of the Earth to assist in the uplifting of humanity. The New Humanity is what I call the Externalization of the Hierarchy. \n Recognize your own power You are the answer for a better planet. Those of you who are reading this are part of the Externalization of the Hierarchy.” \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you. Together we implement lasting changes that will improve your energy, balance and health.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Chronic pain, whether from a pinched nerve, sciatica, arthritis or other conditions can be very frustrating for the sufferer. It is often difficult to treat nerve pain with traditional medications as nerve pain does not respond well to prescription pain relievers, including narcotics. \n Here at One Essence Healing. we treat a range of pain-related conditions, including: \n Any time there is pain in the body, you have sensory nerves which are firing and you might or might not have a structural problem causing the sensory dysfunction. In most cases chronic pain has no structural cause. The problem with most doctors who are not well versed in the field of neurology is their immediate assumption that if you have pain, there must be a structural reason for the pain. In other words, there must be some form of structure, either bone, soft tissue, disc or some object actually pushing on the sensory nerve, causing it to continuously fire. This assumption is not true. \n Actually, in most cases of chronic pain, there are no structural reasons for the pain at all. Yes, your back can look like a corkscrew, but the neural impingement that your doctor is telling you about is inferred from a radiology report. An MRI or X-ray cannot see a nerve. Consequently the medical profession is assuming, based on their idealized knowledge of anatomy, that your pain has to have a structural cause. However, in most cases the sensory nerves are swollen and firing on their own with nothing pushing on them. \n In order for the brain to register pain, there has to be two types of neural signals hitting the brain at about the same time. The first signal is from the sensory nerve or nerves themselves. The second is from the proprioceptive nerves which are also firing right next to the sensory nerves. The proprioceptive nerves tell the brain where your pain is emanating from. If everything is working properly, the brain will release a torrent of what are called enkephalins. These chemicals are the body’s natural pain killers, and they plug up the pain receptor sites in the brain, all along the spine, and on the the capillary beds where you feel the pain. They stop the chronic pain and allow the body to return to normal function. \n Obviously, with those patients who suffer from chronic discomfort, this mechanism is no longer working. There are many reasons the body’s natural pain-relieving mechanism is not working. However, the number one cause appears to be a chronic signal strength problem in the proprioceptive neural tissue. If the neural threshold level (signal strength) is too low, the brain will not know exactly where to release the enkaphalins and thus the pain continues. Acupuncture will raise the signal strength on the proprioceptive pathway and the result is a sudden and dramatic relief from pain. For this reason, we can treat an incredibly wide variety of pain problems (see the list above). \n This technique does have its own problems when a patient’s pain is caused by a structural problem. In this case, there is actual tissue pushing directly on a sensory nerve or group of nerves. Jumping the signal strength on the proprioceptive pathway alone will not solve this type of problem. These patients usually need more invasive procedures, such as surgery. \n Back pain, whether caused by chronic sciatica, a bulging disc, or arthritis is very painful and can be disabling. A person suffering from sciatica has an inflamed sciatic nerve. This nerve starts roughly at the base of the spine, travels down the back of the leg and then stops in your foot. Sciatic pain is difficult to treat because nerve pain does not respond well to painkillers. Sciatica can cause severe, stabbing pain and can make the patient cry out when sudden movements are made. \n Acupuncture works by stimulating the nervous system and allowing for the body to regain balance. There are many scientific studies on acupuncture and the results are conclusive, that acupuncture is effective in relieving certain kinds of pain. \n There are also other ways to relieve back pain without medication. These include physical therapy, and a progressive exercise program that uses both stretching and balance techniques. Back pain may not be completely relieved by exercise or physical therapy alone and that is when alternative treatments become useful. Strengthening the stomach muscles through exercise is a specific way to increase back strength and improve the overall functioning of the low back. \n Shoulder pain is another difficult to treat illness because of the complexity of the shoulder joint. The shoulder is a ball and socket joint, attached together by ligaments and protected by cartilage. If there is ligament damage or the cartilage has worn down, the joint will hurt when it is used. There is no significant way to stop shoulder pain that is caused by worn cartilage without surgery. Acupuncture may help you keep pain at bay while you wait for a surgical procedure. \n Arthritis pain can be felt anywhere in the body where there is a joint, therefore, arthritis pain can be anywhere in the body. Arthritis can be widespread or it can be concentrated in a knee, low back, or shoulder. Arthritis is a very common health ailment for the general public and with early management, arthritis pain does not have to be disabling. You can live with arthritis for a long time without pain if you make changes in your lifestyle that include alternative therapies. \n Those that suffer from arthritis will likely find relief from acupuncture treatments because acupuncture treats the whole body and promotes overall wellness. Arthritis sufferers likely have arthritis in more than one place and analgesics only help for so long. \n Chronic, low grade pain can lead to a decrease in activity and a lack of enjoyment in activities because the pain is just too much to deal with. People that suffer from chronic pain are more prone to depression because they are no longer able to do things that they once enjoyed. They may suffer loneliness and feel that they are suffering alone. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you. Together we implement lasting changes that will improve your energy, balance and health.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n In Oriental medicine the root of excess weight is an imbalance within the body caused by malfunctioning of the spleen and liver organ systems. Acupuncture points, as well as foods and herbs selected to assist with weight loss can directly influence the Qi of the spleen and liver systems and treat the imbalances that have caused weight gain. \n The spleen is responsible for the proper functioning of the digestive system, ensuring that the food we eat is transformed into Qi, the vital substance of life. Disharmony of the spleen will result in symptoms such as fatigue, slow metabolism, water retention, loose stool and a feeling of heaviness. \n The liver’s job is to keep the flow of your body’s Qi, blood and emotions running smoothly. Our modern, fast-paced lifestyle and chronic stress can negatively impact the liver’s ability to function properly and smoothly, which, in turn, can cause the spleen and the entire digestive system to function poorly. One result can be a decrease in your metabolism. Liver disharmony can also cause some of the “triggers” that lead to cravings and compulsive eating. \n Acupuncture and Oriental medicine have been shown to have positive effects on the functioning of the nervous, endocrine and digestive systems. Treatment can help with food cravings and metabolism. These functions all help energize the body, maximize the absorption of nutrients, regulate elimination, control overeating, suppress the appetite and reduce anxiety. \n Acupuncture and Oriental medicine address the issues of over-eating and low metabolism with effective tools to control appetite and increase energy. Energy imbalances are corrected and the digestive and elimination processes are improved so that there is a physical shift in the body to naturally have more energy and desire less food. \n By addressing both the physiological and psychological aspects of weight management concerns, acupuncture and Oriental medicine provide a comprehensive therapy for weight issues that promote better digestion, balance emotions, reduce appetite, improve metabolism and eliminate food cravings. \n Each treatment is customized to the needs of the individual patient. Acupuncture points on the body are chosen for overall well being with the objective of increasing circulation of the blood and Qi (to stimulate the metabolism) and calming the nervous system. Treatments can include a combination of auricular (ear) and body acupuncture, ear tacks or pellets to leave on between treatments, herbs and supplements, abdominal massage, breathing exercises, and food and lifestyle recommendations. \n In addition to treating the root of the imbalance within the body, different acupuncture points may be used for each treatment as different symptoms arise. For instance, if you are experiencing a desire to overeat related to premenstrual syndrome (PMS) one week, then that can be addressed at that week’s appointment. \n The herbs and foods that are chosen during a weight management treatment are for promoting healthy digestion, energizing the body, augmenting Qi, and improving elimination of water, toxins and waste products. Acupuncture points on the abdomen can help improve digestion. They can also help with food absorption and the movement of food through the intestines. \n Deep breathing with visualization can also strengthen will power and be used as a tool to curb hunger and cravings. Most patients report a marked decline in appetite and cravings with acupuncture treatment alone, but special herbs, healing foods and exercises can definitely enhance the efficacy of the treatments. \n Acupuncture and Oriental medicine are powerful tools for achieving a healthy weight, by itself or as a supportive treatment in conjunction with other weight management programs. \n Contact us today and schedule a consultation to see how acupuncture and Oriental medicine can assist you with your weight management goals and help you to live a long, healthy life! \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Gastrointestinal disorders are uncomfortable, painful, sometimes embarrassing, and can often be aided with the help of Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine. Among the gastrointestinal disorders we treat are: \n Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or IBS, is a typical disease pattern that we treat every day. Patients come to us most often because Western Medicine is not very effective at treating IBS. Chinese Medicine seeks out what we consider to be the causes of the problem, and treats those. We do not treat the symptoms of this disease. \n Typical causes of IBS as detected by Chinese Medicine are: Heat or inflammation of the large or small intestines; emotional disturbances (either depression affecting the digestive system, or liver inflammation affecting the digestive system); or simply an overall weakness in the power of the digestive system, in which case patients often complain of fatigue, and usually speak with a soft voice. Traditional Chinese Medicine has a good track record in treating all of these causes. Recovery time is usually one month of treatment for every year you have had the problem. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Depression is one of the most common complaints we treat at One Essence Healing and Chinese Pulse Diagnosis can help us to determine the etiology of the depression, and Chinese Herbal Medicine, combined with Acupuncture, offers positive results. \n Conditions we treat include, but are not limited to: \n Treating smoking, drug, or alcohol addiction using Acupuncture has been well researched in the United States. The results show that the success rate is about the same as other methods, specifically about 50%. For this reason, in our office we combine both Acupuncture and Chinese herbs, which greatly increases the success rate. \n The role of Acupuncture in nicotine cessation isn’t limited to reducing cravings. Acupuncture has also been shown to promote relaxation and better sleep. Moreover, Acupuncture can be used to treat many disorders associated with smoking, such as damage to the bronchopulmonary and cardiovascular systems and the symptoms from nicotine withdrawal. In our experience, the effectiveness of Acupuncture to stop smoking varies with many factors, including the length of time the patient has been smoking, their overall health, and the frequency of treatment. In many cases, we will also use Auricular (ear) Acupuncture to help the patient retain the effects of Acupuncture between treatments. \n As of 2010, we have treated ADD in our clinic about 20 times. For those who went through the course of treatments, our success rate has been good. Success means no more drugs and a 80% reduction of symptoms. \n Treating this problem in children is extremely heartwarming. We have had several parents literally crying with joy because their children are behaving normally and are no longer on medication. In Chinese Medicine, the most common causes of this disease are either weakness of the lung, adrenal gland, and thyroid combined with slight anemia; or excessive heat/inflammation in the body causing enormous agitation. In either case, Chinese Medicine works very well and quickly too, especially with children. \n Depression and anxiety are two of the most common diseases we treat; usually seeing 20 or 30 patients a day. In Chinese Medicine there are at least 10 different causes of these conditions. First, we determine the etiology (causes) for the problem using Pulse Diagnosis. Once we are certain of the cause, the treatment follows automatically. For mild forms of depression and anxiety, our success rate is encouraging. For more severe problems such as bipolar disease or schizophrenia, Western Medicine appears to work better. \n The inability to sleep properly is one of the worst maladies that a patient can suffer. Insomnia makes everything worse — pain, anxiety, digestive disorders and a host of other problems. In Western Medicine, pharmaceutical drugs are the treatment of choice. The problem with these drugs, such as zolpidem (Ambien), eszopiclone (Lunesta), zaleplon (Sonata) or ramelteon (Rozerem), is that they can cause severe allergic reactions, facial swelling and unusual behaviors, such as driving or preparing and eating food while asleep. Side effects of prescription sleeping medications are often more pronounced in older people and may include excessive drowsiness, impaired thinking, night wandering, agitation and balance problems. \n In our clinic, we treat insomnia using Acupuncture and Chinese Herbs. In Chinese Medicine, insomnia is just a sign of lack of health and function. By restoring the patient to normal function the insomnia goes away. From our point of view, insomnia drugs do not restore a patient to normal function. They are largely used to subdue the symptom without any regard for the overall health of the individual. \n However, in fairness, Western Medicine is expanding its horizons and is now recommending improved diet and exercise as a way of treating insomnia. We applaud this approach, since it is much healthier than loading the patient up on drugs, especially if they are seniors. In Chinese Medicine, insomnia is usually a dysfunction in the heart or liver. If blood flow to the heart is slightly diminished the patient will have a hard time falling asleep. If the liver is inflamed or sluggish the patient will wake up a number of times at night. Both of these etiologies are treated very well using Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine. \n Childbirth is by far the largest strain on the human body for most women. The loss of blood and fluid at childbirth combined with sleep deprivation during the first year of the child’s life leaves most women tired, anxious and depressed. Western Medicine usually treats the problem with iron supplements if there is measurable anemia, counseling, and hormone replacement, along with anti-depressants or serotonin re-uptake drugs. \n Chinese Medicine takes a different approach. One of the gifts that Chinese Medicine gave the world is the knowledge and use of what are known as tonic herbs, such as ginseng, astragalus and many more. With this class of herbs a well-trained Chinese herbalist rebuilds the vitality and strength of a woman suffering from postpartum depression. The results are usually better than the Western approach and help restore the patient to their former level of vitality, prior to becoming pregnant. \n Stress and tension are very easily treated with either Acupuncture or Chinese Herbs. Even an inexperienced practitioner will be able to handle these two issues very well. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you. Together we implement lasting changes that will improve your energy, balance and health.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Here at One Essence Healing we treat a number of issues relating to women’s health. It’s our goal to help you feel better, and we’ll start with a relaxed consultation, a review of your medical history, pulse diagnosis, and a discussion of our findings and recommended treatments. \n Conditions we treat include, but are not limited to: \n Other than back pain, fatigue, anxiety and depression are the most common complaints that we treat in our clinic. In many cases, the fatigue is being caused by the excessive use of pharmaceuticals that the patient is taking, especially beta-blockers. With the permission and cooperation of the patient’s medical doctor, it is usually possible to reduce the number of drugs the patient is taking, especially those most responsible for the fatigue. \n In the State of Washington, an East Asian Medical Practitioner is not legally permitted to prescribe or adjust a patient’s medication. What we do find is that doctors are quite amenable when it comes to adjusting prescriptions. \n If the fatigue is not drug-related, then Chinese medicine is an excellent solution. Either the patient has too much toxicity in their system, or they are simply devoid of nutrients and low-level anemia is present. In either case, these problems can be improved using Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine. \n An analogy we often use is one of a garden hose which has no water coming out at the nozzle. Either the hose is pinched (too much toxicity), causing a reduction in water flow, or there simply is not enough water in the hose (weakness and anemia). Even though the complaint, fatigue, is the same for both problems, the methods of fixing the problems are completely different. \n Many women are suffering from this syndrome, which has no cure in Western Medicine. Clinically, we treat this problem at least five times a day with good results. \n In Chinese medicine, we find two etiologies (causes) for fibromyalgia. The first is very poor blood circulation, almost always due to obesity. For every extra 10 pounds we have on our frames, the diameter of our blood vessels are cut in half (Mayo Clinic). If the patient is overweight, then there is a systemic lack of nutrient (Ying) and oxygen (Qi) circulation to all the major muscle groups of the body and the sensory nerves which surround them. The result is constant chronic pain. \n Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine appear to be vasodilating the major longitudinal blood vessels of the body, thereby providing more oxygen and nutrients to the malnourished muscle groups. The result is a dramatic reduction of pain over a short period of time. \n The second etiology is also malnourishment, but from a different cause. Some fibromyalgia suffers are simply anemic or borderline anemic. The anemia is a plasma anemia which Western Medicine fails to acknowledge. This type of patient is thin, frail, has dry skin, does not sleep well, is usually anxious and jumpy, and of course has a lot of pain, especially in the upper body. Chinese Herbal Medicine seeks to restore the fluid deficiency in the blood and body. The result is an improvement in the condition known as fibromyalgia. \n Did you know that treating infertility with Acupuncture and TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) has been recorded in our ancient texts, and even on the backs of turtle shells, for thousands of years? How can this age-old medicine make such a difference? In the last five years the science behind many studies reveal that: \n The American Society of Reproductive Medicine’s Fertility \u0026 Sterility Journal has concluded the utility of acupuncture in conjunction with assisted reproductive technology. With all this evidence in the last five years, you would think that every reproductive clinic in the world would require their patients to receive acupuncture. Thanks to the role that acupuncture and TCM has played in helping women get pregnant, and the media coverage it has received in recent years, all of that is changing.\nMenopause \n Menopause is the permanent end of menstruation and fertility, defined as occuring 12 months after your last menstrual period. Menopause is a natural biological process, not a medical illness. Even so, the physical and emotional symptoms of menopause can disrupt your sleep, sap your energy and — at least indirectly — trigger feelings of sadness and loss.\nChinese medicine has been treating menopause for at least 2,000 years. The patient can expect the main symptoms of night sweats and hot flashes to be gone fairly quickly. The emotional upset that can go with menopause is treated very effectively with Chinese Herbal Medicine. In short, women suffering from menopause can expect an improvement in their symptoms using TCM. \n Among the most common complaints that we treat daily are menstrual disorders. Whether the problem is no period, too much bleeding, or excessive pain and cramping during menses, these are all problems readily handled by Chinese Herbal Medicine. Pain at period time is almost always due to vessel blockage in the lower abdomen. This can be caused by vaso-spasms in the vessels of the lower abdomen, excessive cold in the in the lower abdomen, fibroid cysts, or a disease known as endometriosis. All of these conditions, if not too structurally severe, are usually improved through a series of Acupuncture visits and the use of Chinese Herbal Medicine. \n Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) refers to a wide range of physical or emotional symptoms that typically occur about 5-11 days before a woman starts her monthly menstrual cycle. The symptoms usually start when menstruation begins, or shortly thereafter. In Chinese medicine, PMS is almost always attributable to poor blood flow through the liver at the time of menses. Encouraging better circulation through the hepatic artery, which delivers 70% of the blood to the liver, can be very effective in helping with these problems. The Chinese discovered almost 2,500 years ago that emotional upset, in most cases, is a result of poor circulation through the liver. Over the centuries, the Chinese developed several methods for increasing blood flow to and through this vital organ. Once the liver is functioning properly, the emotional ups and downs are greatly reduced. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you. Together we implement lasting changes that will improve your energy, balance and health.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Among the dermatological disorders treated at One Essence Healing are: \n It is common knowledge that skin diseases such as psoriasis, eczema, acne, and vitilego are not treated well with Western Medicine. Hives and Uticaria are treated well with drugs, but only symptomatically. In Western Medicine, the true cause of such disorders remains somewhat murky. Consequently, treatments are usually in the form of topical medicine, which is not adequate to remove the cause of the problem. There are pharmaceutically drugs which treat these diseases systemically, but there are many unwanted side effects, making treatment more difficult. \n Skin diseases or dermatological disorders are also difficult to treat with Traditional Chinese Medicine, but with one big difference. In TCM we have clear causes or etiologies for such diseases, and the treatment for them goes far beyond superficial topical ones. In treating psoriasis and eczema in our clinic, we expect a 40% improvement fairly quickly, with improvement beyond that level over time. There are no side effects of treatment and the patient will feel an overall improvement in health and vitality. Treatment consists of both Acupuncture and custom Chinese Herbal formulas. \n Skin diseases that respond well to Chinese Herbal Medicine are categorized as follows: \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Whether you turn to acupuncture or allopathic medicine for healing, choosing the right foods for your constitution will speed your progress. \n According to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), health is a state of balance in which food choice is key. As a longtime nutritionist I can report profound positive changes when people get their food selections right. \n Nutritional balance from a TCM perspective is far different from that of Western nutrition. Modern nutrition science is based on knowing the chemical composition of foods and the biochemical pathways of the body. Western nutritionists quantify nutrients such as protein, carbohydrates, and fat, then group foods accordingly, with a one-size-fits-all serving recommendation. \n The Food Pyramid, for example, groups bread, pasta, grains, and potatoes together as “carbohydrates” and suggests 5 to 8 servings. According to TCM, however, bread and pasta are damp and cooling, and thus are not recommended for someone overweight, bloated, or suffering sinus congestion. Sprouted grains, rye, and wild rice, although also carbohydrates, do not contribute to dampness because they have energetic properties different from flour and can actually be helpful for people with such yin conditions. \n According to Eastern traditions the forces of yin and yang are energetic qualities that shape everything in the universe, including our health. The Chinese symbol for yin is the shady side of a hill, while the symbol for yang is the sunny side. Thus yin qualities include coolness, dampness, and darkness, relative to the yang qualities of warmth, dryness, and light. Winter is yin, while summer is yang, and night is yin while day is yang. Arthritis made worse by cold weather is a yin condition. A red, inflamed rash brought on by heat is a yang condition. A ruddy-faced, irritable man with high blood pressure is relatively yang. An anemic, melancholy woman is relatively yin. \n Yin foods tend to be cooling and/or moistening for the body. Yang foods tend to be warming and drying. This has less to do with the actual temperature or moisture of the food and more to do with its “energetics.” Boiled spinach for example, is cooling and moistening, as is baked tofu. Chilled wine is warming, as is roast beef. Toast, while dry to touch, actually moistens the body. The effects of such food qualities on health have been observed for thousands of years. \n Your acupuncturist is trained to balance your body’s constitution. By observing your body and understanding the energetics of food, you can make food and activity choices to speed your body’s healing progress. Imbalance can come from an excess, or deficiency, of yin or yang. Although more complex than this, the following is an overview of yin and yang patterns of imbalance and the food choices that can help restore balance. Your constitution is ever changing, so be sure you adjust with the seasons and your life situation. \n A cold pattern often occurs in vegetarians or those who eat primarily raw foods, especially when they live in the cold. Cold can also set in with age and may be combined with dampness. Regular, warming aerobic exercise is essential. Healing food choices include warm lamb or beef dishes, dark poultry, meat-based soups and stews, free-range eggs, eel, trout, and wild salmon. Beneficial vegetables include cooked root veggies, baked winter squash, onions, and mustard greens. Nuts and seeds are warming, as are butter, cinnamon, garlic, ginger, turmeric, and pepper. Helpful grains include oatmeal, quinoa, and buckwheat. Food and drinks are best eaten cooked and warm. Salads, raw fruits, frozen desserts, pasta, white flour, and iced beverages should be minimized. \n Dampness can be associated with cold or heat and is exacerbated by damp living conditions. Chronic dampness is brought on by eating on the run, excessive worry, or from a diet rich in fried foods, breads, pasta, commercial dairy, ice cream, and other sweets. Too many salads and raw fruits weaken digestion and lead to dampness. Aerobic exercise is essential for balance. \n Helpful foods include lightly cooked greens including broccoli, turnip greens, asparagus, and kale. Fish and grilled or roasted meats and poultry are balancing. The best grains for a damp pattern are rye, jasmine, and basmati rice as well as sprouted grains. Radishes, turnips, pumpkin seeds, green tea, and bitter foods and herbs help to dry dampness. \n Sweets, dairy, and starchy foods contribute to dampness. Ice cream, lasagna, white bread, and milk should be avoided. \n A heat pattern often shows up in hot weather or with stress. Overwork, alcohol, and sugar heat the body. Meditation, walks in nature, swimming, and/or yoga are ideal for balancing the agitated nature of a heat imbalance. Ideal foods are salads, cucumbers, and lightly cooked green leafy vegetables especially spinach and watercress. Vegetables of all kinds are helpful whereas meats should be limited. \n Other cooling foods include melons, pears, bean dishes, mung beans, sprouts, sushi, non-spicy soups, and lots of water. Alcohol and sugar are best avoided. Mint is a beneficial cooling herb whereas pepper, garlic, ginger, and onions should be reduced. \n A dry pattern is a deficiency of yin, or fluids. Hormones, skin oils, saliva, digestive juices and secretions provide us our yin element. Fluids are akin to a car’s antifreeze; when low you can easily overheat or freeze. We see dryness at menopause, or as we age and skin becomes dry. Although hot flashes feel like heat, they are a sign of diminishing yin, which allows the normal heat of the body to go unchecked. Stress also depletes yin. \n Remedies include meditation, yoga, walks in nature and gardening. Beneficial fats are critical. Healthful choices include fatty fish, free-range eggs, grass-fed butter, goat and sheep cheeses, olive and coconut oil, dark poultry meat, pork, nuts, and avocado. Soups and stews rich with grass-fed animal fats are very helpful. Other moistening foods include black beans, green beans, Napa cabbage, winter squash, yams, sea vegetables, millet, whole wheat, fermented soy, and shellfish. \n Summer foods such as salads, cucumbers, and melons are ideal for hot weather. Conversely meats, root vegetables, hot soups, and stews are most nourishing in winter.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Dr. Fuhrman coined the word Nutritarian, but; at One Essence Healing it best describes the philosophy of a lifestyle we practice which concentrates on eating the most micronutrient rich foods. \n Simply put, a Nutritarian is a way of eating which bases food choices on maximizing the micronutrients per calorie. A Nutritarian lifestyle is designed with food that has powerful disease-protecting and therapeutic effects and delivers a broad array of micronutrients via a wide spectrum of food choices. It is not sufficient to merely avoid fats, consume foods with a low glycemic index, lower the intake of animal products, or eat a diet of mostly raw foods. A truly healthful Nutritarian lifestyle must be micronutrient rich and the micronutrient richness must be adjusted to meet individual needs. The foods with the highest micronutrient per calorie scores are green vegetables, colorful vegetables, and fresh fruits. For optimal health and to combat disease, it is necessary to consume enough of these foods that deliver the highest concentration of nutrients. \n  \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Raw and Living foods are uncooked, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, sprouted grains, sea vegetables, and fermented foods. These raw foods can be eaten whole or combined to make the healthiest, most delicious meals. \n Sound boring? That’s what we thought when we first heard about raw-live foods. Then we tasted the food.and were VERY surprised!!! What we didn’t know was that you could make all kinds of foods that are easy to make and are delicious. Recipes include things such as “burgers, pasta, pizza, veggie stir fry, cookies, and ice cream.” You just make things with healthy ingredients instead of processed ones and don’t cook at high temperatures so you don’t lose nutrients, enzymes and the vital life force of the food. \n Dr. McReynolds: I know this may sound like a commercial, but here are the main reasons: The food tastes great and is EASY to prepare. (Unless “cooking” is preparation is quick and easy, I don’t do it.) Other good news: my health has improved. I had been a vegetarian for many years, but it wasn’t until I transitioned to the raw-vegan lifestyle, that I don’t have that constant “run down” feeling. The biggest surprise for me was that the headaches I was having several times per weeks resolved. Also, my mental clarity and Spiritual walking have improved. I’d like to say that these changes did not take place overnight. They took several months, so don’t expect a quick fix. \n Dr. Weinthal: I’d like to give you a little background first. For me, food has always meant big family gatherings and cooking lots of “good food.” I don’t think I would have ever considered eating raw-live food if it hadn’t tasted so good. I still cook for large gatherings, but nowadays it is much more healthy. The food just tastes amazing and I feel great. A few years ago I needed 1-2 pots of coffee to make it through the day. I never thought I could have energy without drinking coffee. Would you believe that I don’t drink coffee anymore and have more energy that I could have ever imagined? Also, I used to have “digestion problems.” I’m very happy to say that these have also resolved. Like Dr. McReynolds, I have more mental clarity and better attunement. \n People report healing of: fibromyalgia, migraines, back pain, neck and joint pain, asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, hypoglycemia, colitis, diverticulitis, candida, arthritis, serious allergies, depression, anxiety, mood swings, heartburn, gas, bloating, constipation, skin diseases, obesity, chronic fatigue, obesity, cancers and many more. Most report increased energy and feeling just feeling better overall. \n Come to a raw/living food meetup to have fun, share live food, discuss raw lifestyle, and optimum wellness. Anyone interested in conscious eating for physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual brilliance is welcome. \n Come, let’s build a raw food community in Georgetown, Texas! \n Are you interested in meeting others who share your enthusiasm about achieving high energy health and vitality by incorporating whole, raw and living foods into their life?\nWould you like to learn new recipes, share stories, learn valuable health information and get support? \n Come to the Wellness Cafe to meet others interested in raw and living foods and health, get support, enjoy some raw tasty treats and a live speaker related to the raw foods lifestyle and health. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you. Together we implement lasting changes that will improve your energy, balance and health.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Superfoods are vibrant, nutritionally dense foods that have recently become widely available and which offer tremendous dietary and healing potential. There are many delicious and incredibly nutritious plant products such as goji berries, hemp seed, cacao beans (raw chocolate), maca, spirulina, bee products, and a host of others. As powerful sources of clean protein, vitamins, minerals, enzymes, antioxidants, good fats and oils, essential fatty and amino acids, and other nutrients, they represent a uniquely promising piece of the nutritional puzzle. \n Bee Pollen tastes slightly sweet (low glycemic), creamy with rich floral overtones. \n Bee Pollen uses include smoothies, salad dressings and eating by the handful. \n Bee Pollen with Hemp Seeds and Coconut are a natural match for Cacao (Chocolate) drinks. \n Bee Pollen supports maximum immune strength. There is little difference in local Bee Pollen as Histidine (amino acid) levels are what support immune function. \n Bee Pollen with Hemp Seeds and Cacao (Chocolate) rapidly balance women’s hormonal systems. \n Hemp Seeds are rich in protein (33%+), Omega 3/6 EFAs, GLA, Chlorophyll, and SDA (Stearidonic Acid) which increases EPA concentrations in eye/brain tissue. \n Hemp seeds taste slightly sweet (low glycemic), creamy with rich nutty, buttery and heavy cream flavors. \n Hemp seed uses include smoothies, salad dressings and eating by the handful. Hemp Seeds with Bee Pollen and Coconut are a natural match for Raw Cacao (Chocolate) drinks. \n Hemp seeds have an adaptive flavor. They can be used in both sweet or savory (non-sweet) recipes. Hemp seeds tend to amplify whatever flavors are present with them, especially sweeteners like Agave Nectar and pungent spices. \n Hemp fiber was used for clothes, sails and ropes of ships colonizing our world. The Declaration of Independence is written on Hemp paper. America was the world’s largest Hemp producer through the 1940′s until the paper, clothing and soybean lobbies joined forces to ban THC-free Hemp, to increase their profits. \n Your high-octane Super Food, Chocolate Drink additive. \n Uses: Rain Forest Rush was designed as an additive to Raw Super Food drinks and recipes, especially Chocolate drinks like Chocolate Bliss. It adds an entire new range of flavors and effects, specifically enhancing circulation, fluid exchange in brain/nerve tissue and rebooting peak cell function. \n Rain Forest Rush consists of: Guarana, Bee Pollen, Yerba Matte, Maca, Psyllium, Blue Green Algae, Grasses (Barley, Wheat, Alfalfa, Dandelion, Oat) and Sun Fire Salt. \n Tocotrienols are a cold processed, enzymatically stabilized, whole rice bran rich in Vitamin E oils with 100-1000 times more antioxidant potential than Vitamin E related tocopherols. \n This unique mix of proteins, oils, antioxidants and fiber greatly enhances Vitamin A metabolism. Tocos are a powerful synergist with Camu Camu and MSM for cell/tissue/skin integrity and with Cacao Butter for rapid remyelination of neural sheathing. \n Adds a great malt flavor to recipes, and combines equally well in Cacao drinks, dessert recipes and savory dishes. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n I came to Dr. Weinthal a little over two months ago, seeking an alternative to undergoing an epidural steroid injection to treat pain, numbness, and tingling in my shoulder, neck, and arm, caused by arthritic bone spurs pushing on nerves.   I wanted not only relief from pain, but education on how I could do things to minimize my discomfort.  I got BOTH! \n Dr. Weinthal not only used acupuncture and Chinese herbs to help me, but also he educated me about proper intake of vitamins and minerals and the use of various exercises.  I am happy to report that after only a couple weeks' treatment and application of exercise and better nutrition, I was able to stop taking ibuprofen and other painkillers completely.  Even better, I have been able to resume my normal activities of walking, swimming, playing with grandchildren, cooking, and cleaning, when at one point before treatment I could hardly cut my own food with a fork!  I am very grateful to Dr. Weinthal for his caring treatment! \n Dr. Weinthal, \n We are very thankful for you! Though we came to treat kip, you have also positively influenced our family's health and nutrition. I appreciate your willingness to share your knowledge. At times you have been a confirmation and a motivator to explore healthier habits and options. Crossing paths with you has been an important milestone in our family's journey to exceptional everyday life and health. \n Thanks! We'll see ya soon! \n   \n   \n I suffered with chronic shoulder  pain for 10 years, a MRI diagnosed me with bursitis and a possible tear of the rotator cuff. Also recovering from a broken ankle and carpal tunnel in both hands, I was in great need of a miracle.  My son met Dr. Weinthal in his Health Science Technology class at school, where he came and spoke to the class about acupuncture and natural healing.   Two days before surgery, I decided to see Dr. Weinthal, who treated all the above areas and also prescribed herbs.   Today, I am pain free and able do the things I enjoy. \n Thanks to Dr. Weinthal and his acupuncture treatments, I have a better quality of life. \n Also for encouraging my son and his classmates to persue their dreams. \n I was suffering with food allergies including a gluten intolerance, anxiety and other sensitivities and had been told that I would have to abstain from eating certain foods for the rest of my life. Then I found out about a treatment called NAET. After seeing one practitioner who I was not completely satisfied with I found Dr. Weinthal. To me, Dr. Weinthal is unlike many doctors in that he took the time to first talk with me over the phone about my symptoms, answer my questions, explain how allergies work, etc. And then when I saw him what struck me was how compassionate and sensitive to my needs he was. Not only is he a Doctor of Oriental Medicine/acupuncturist but he listens like a guidance counselor would as well! He really wants to help you. I have done many treatments with Dr. Weinthal and over the period of treatments I could feel that my immune system was overall improving. I was less sensitive to smells, my hair was not falling out anymore, and most significantly I could eat gluten again! I continue to see Dr. Weinthal when I need a health booster and tell all my friends who have allergies about him! \n I’ve suffered from allergies, headaches, and chronic sinusitis for years; surgery, allergy shots, and prescription medication had not stopped the cycle of chronic infection. \n When I came to see Dr. Weinthal I had an acute sinus infection, and had developed allergies to several antibiotics. I couldn't start my day without a large dose of ibuprofen, nasal spray, decongestant, saline rinses, and even then I was dragging and spending hours napping. \n I was thrilled when I got noticeable relief from my congestion and pain with the first acupuncture treatment. Since seeing Dr. Weinthal for acupuncture and NAET, my sinus problems have diminished, I have had MUCH more energy, and I rarely reach for ibuprofen or anything else. My previous medical beliefs based on Western models have been turned topsy-turvy, but I’m delighted. \n After experiencing chronic pain for several months, I made an appointment with Dr. Weinthal for acupuncture treatments. When I began treatment my pain level was so intense that I could no longer lead a normal life. Nothing, including prescription pain medications, had alleviated my pain. Dr. Weinthal's calming presence helped ease my nervousness about acupuncture. He took the time to explain the treatment process and thoroughly answered my questions. My pain began to lessen after my first treatment and after several weeks of acupuncture I was pain free. Acupuncture has allowed me to regain my life. \n Dr. Weinthal definitely has an authentic gift for healing. Not only is he knowledgeable and skilled in Eastern medicine, but he is deeply intuitive and empathetic regarding the needs of his clients.\nWhen I came to to Dr. Weinthal I was in crisis, not only physically, but on each level of my Being. I was hormonally imbalanced, exhausted, and suffering from frequent migraine headaches and nausea. My emotional self was vulnerable and tentative; mentally I was often unclear and scattered; and, my spiritual self was malnourished. \n As a result of Dr. Weinthal's comprehensive attention to the needs of my Whole Being I feel like my potential has been awakened. My energy level and zest for life are steadily increasing. Hormonally I am becoming regulated and balanced. Additionally, my symptoms of headache and nausea are becoming less frequent and intense. I feel more grounded and stable emotionally. And, mentally, I am clearer and more focused. Spiritually I feel more nourished and open to receive. Overall, through his unique healing approach, Dr. Weinthal has facilitated the activation of my own natural healing resources. I am deeply appreciative and grateful for Dr. Weinthal and his authentic, heart-centered, healing work. \n I had tension headaches and migraines every day for the past 17 years. I saw Dr. Weinthal and had only 2 slight headaches between treatments. Dr. Weinthal also prescribed herbs for me that I take everyday. I go weeks if not longer without headaches. If I stop taking the herbs or miss my treatments, the pain comes back and I can't work some days. \n I have also had panic attacks for the past year. I used to wake up with heart palpitations and vomiting. Dr. Weinthal also prescibed another herb for me that has made a world of difference. He has also worked with me on spiritual healing that has helped bring balance to my work and personal life. \n Dr. Weinthal definitely has an authentic gift for healing. Not only is he knowledgeable and skilled in Eastern medicine, but he is deeply intuitive and empathetic regarding the needs of his clients. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you. Together we implement lasting changes that will improve your energy, balance and health.

Like calmness and strength, these outward features are universally attractive. While we work towards these qualities with regimens that may include exercise, meditation, or even using a nice shampoo, the foods we eat are key to achieving inner and outer beauty. \n In traditional Chinese medicine, foods are prescribed for their effects on organs, blood, yin, yang, and Qi, the major players in our physical and emotional health. Foods such as rice, seaweed, sweet potatoes, and bananas nourish our yin, which in turn hydrates and nourishes organs. Think of a parched plant; after a good watering it becomes more tumescent. Eating yin-enhancing foods nourishes the body in a way that simple drinking water cannot. \n Sweet black rice, when cooked with longan berries (euphoria longana) and Chinese dates, becomes a congee that nourishes blood and Qi.

Like calmness and strength, these outward features are universally attractive. While we work towards these qualities with regimens that may include exercise, meditation, or even using a nice shampoo, the foods we eat are key to achieving inner and outer beauty. \n In traditional Chinese medicine, foods are prescribed for their effects on organs, blood, yin, yang, and Qi, the major players in our physical and emotional health.

Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat and simmer for two hours, stirring occasionally. Garnish with ginger. Makes four servings.\nNote: All ingredients are available at most Asian grocery stores. \n  \n Adding nutrient-rich super foods to the diet can give men a healthy boost. \n Here are just a few foods that can help maintain muscle mass, prevent prostate cancer, and more. \n Avocados\nAvocados are a good source of vitamin K, dietary fiber, vitamin B6, vitamin C, folate and copper.  Rich in potassium, avocados contain more of this nutrient than bananas.  Potassium is needed to regulate nerves, heartbeat and, especially, blood pressure.  An added bonus for men: Avocados inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells. \n Blackberries\nBlackberries are packed with Vitamin C, calcium and magnesium, with more than double the amounts than their popular cousin, the blueberry.  Vitamin C is a powerful stress reducer that can lower blood pressure and return cortisol levels to normal faster when taken during periods of stress.  Magnesium and calcium act together to help regulate the nerves and muscle tone. \n Too little magnesium in your diet can cause nerve cells to become over activated and can trigger muscular tension, soreness, spasms, cramps, and fatigue.  Blackberries also score high on the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) scale assesses the antioxidant content of food: the higher the score, the better the food’s ability to neutralize cell-damaging free radicals that lead to cancer. \n Spinach\nSpinach is one of the most nutrient-dense foods in existence.  Spinach can help protect against prostate cancer, reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke, lower blood pressure and strengthen muscles. \n Walnuts\nWhen it comes to their health benefits, walnuts are the king of nuts. Richer in heart-healthy omega-3s than salmon, loaded with more anti-oxidants than red wine, and packing half as much muscle-building protein as chicken, walnuts are one of the all time super foods. \n Yogurt\nEating yogurt that contains live bacterial cultures every day improves digestive health, boosts the immune system, provides protection against cancer and may help you live longer.   Not all yogurts are probiotic though, so make sure the label says “live and active cultures.” \n Let us custom-tailor a treatment plan that will best suit your individual needs so that you can feel better quickly and safely! \n  \n Acupuncture views nutrition in a complex light, through the application of Oriental medicine wisdom to dietary habits. In short, certain foods are considered too yang, or hot to eat in excess during the warmer months, while others are prized for their yin ability to cool the body. Overall, the goal is balance between the internal yin and yang of the body. \n A healthy, nutritional diet, good sleep and moderate exercise can keep your skin and physical form at its best. \n For healthy skin, be sure to integrate these foods into your diet: \n Carrots and Sweet Potatoes: \n Healthy skin is directly dependent on the amount of vitamin A in our diet. Vitamin A acts as an antioxidant to neutralize harmful elements in our skin, helping to prevent wrinkles, resist infection and maintain the skin’s elasticity. Some of the best sources of Vitamin A are vegetables that are deep orange in color. \n Blackberries, Blueberries, Strawberries, and Plums:  \n In a study recently published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, these four fruits weighed in with the highest “total antioxidant capacity” of any food.  The antioxidants and other phytochemicals in these fruits can protect cells from damage and disintegration, thus guarding against premature aging. \n Salmon, Walnuts, Olive Oil, and Flax Seed:  \n Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are responsible for skin repair, moisture content, and overall elasticity, but because the body cannot produce its own EFAs, they must be obtained through the diet. Fish, walnuts, and flax seed oil are among the best sources for omega 3 fatty acids. Eating good-quality olive oil helps keep skin lubricated and keeps it looking and feeling healthier overall. Which olive oils are the best for your skin? Those labeled “cold pressed,” “expeller processed,” or “extra virgin” are the least processed forms. As a result, they contain the highest levels of antioxidant substances. \n Whole Wheat Bread, Brown Rice, Turkey, Tuna and Brazil Nuts:  \n Selenium is an antioxidant mineral responsible for tissue elasticity and healthy skin. It may also play an important role in preventing skin cancer, as some recent studies are showing that skin damaged by the sun may suffer fewer consequences if selenium levels are high. \n Green Tea:  \n Green tea’s ability to slow down the development of some signs of aging is attributed to its high levels of polyphenols, which have been well-documented for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Green tea may help prevent or reduce the risk of skin cancer according to a study published recently in the Archives of Dermatology, which shows that whether taken orally or applied to the skin, green tea can reduce the risk of damage from ultraviolet light and thus reduce the risk of skin cancer. \n Water : \n  Hydration plays a key role in keeping skin cells healthy. It is essential to maintaining your skin’s elasticity and suppleness. Keeping cells hydrated helps cells move nutrients in and toxins out, which helps keep skin clean and clear. \n Let us help you to optimize your skin health! \n Acupuncture and Oriental medicine can be very effective at treating skin conditions. Treatments can provide quick relief for acute symptoms and significant and lasting relief from recurrent or chronic skin conditions. \n The skin reflects and reacts to imbalances within the body’s internal landscape and the effects of the environment. Internal disharmonies caused by strong emotions, diet, and your constitution, as well as environmental influences such as wind, dryness, dampness, and heat, can all contribute to the development of a skin disorder. To keep your skin healthy and beautiful on the outside, you must work on the inside of your body as well. Increasing the flow of energy, blood and lymph circulation improves the skin’s natural healthy color. \n Promotion of collagen production increases muscle tone and elasticity, helping to firm the skin. Stimulating the formation of body fluids nourishes the skin and encourages it to be moister, softer, smoother and more lustrous. \n General skin conditions that can be treated with acupuncture and Oriental medicine include acne, dermatitis, eczema, pruritus, psoriasis, rosacea, shingles and urticaria (hives). Oriental medicine does not recognize skin problems as one particular syndrome. Instead, it aims to treat the specific symptoms that are unique to each individual using a variety of techniques with acupuncture, such as herbal medicine, bodywork, lifestyle/dietary recommendations and energetic exercises to restore imbalances found in the body. Therefore, if 10 patients are treated with Oriental medicine for eczema, each patient will receive a unique, customized treatment with different lifestyle and dietary recommendations. \n If you suffer from a skin condition or would like to know how to optimize your skin health, Contact One Essence Healing to learn more about how acupuncture and Oriental medicine can help you. \n More than 95 million Americans suffer from digestive disorders ranging from constipation, diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome to more serious conditions such as acid reflux (GERD), ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. In fact, more than 35 million physician office visits a year are due to gastrointestinal complaints. Reports are confirming that acupuncture and Oriental medicine can offer relief from even the most complex digestive problems. \n Evidence that Oriental medicine has been used for digestive disorders can be found in early medical literature dating back to 3 AD, where specific acupuncture points and herbal formulas for borborygmus (rumbling or gurgling in the intestines), abdominal pain and diarrhea with pain are discussed. \n According to Oriental medical theory, most digestive disorders are due to disharmony in the spleen and stomach. The spleen plays a central part in the health and vitality of the body, taking a lead role in the assimilation of nutrients and maintenance of physical strength. It turns digested food from the stomach into usable nutrients and qi (energy). Many schools of thought have been formed around this organ; the premise being that the proper functioning of the”‘middle” is the key to all aspects of vitality. \n By taking into account a person’s constitution and varied symptoms, a treatment plan is designed specifically for the individual to bring their “middle” back into harmony and optimize the proper functioning of the digestive system. A variety of techniques can be used during treatment including acupuncture, lifestyle/dietary recommendations and energetic exercises to restore digestive health. \n Is your digestive system functioning as well as it could? Acupuncture and Oriental medicine are extremely effective at treating a wide array of digestive disorders. Contact us today to learn more about how acupuncture and Oriental medicine can be integrated into your digestive wellness plan! \n Repetitive stress injuries (RSI) are the most common job-related injuries and are responsible for the highest number of days lost among all work related injuries. One of the most well-known types of repetitive stress injury, carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) accounts for over two million visits to physicians’ offices and approximately 465,000 carpal tunnel release operations each year, making it the most frequent surgery of the hand and wrist. \n Symptoms of repetitive stress injuries include tightness, stiffness, pain, tingling, numbness, coldness and loss of strength in the arm. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a repetitive stress injury that refers specifically to the inflammation of a specific ligament that puts pressure on the median nerve. \n Acupuncture is extremely effective for treating repetitive stress injuries including carpal tunnel syndrome; eliminating the need for surgery or the use of anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids. In fact, one of the most common reasons that people get acupuncture is for repetitive stress injuries. Recent studies even suggest that acupuncture may be more effective than corticosteroids when it comes to treating CTS. \n The carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway in the wrist made up of ligaments and bones. The median nerve and the tendons that connect the fingers to the muscles of the forearm pass through this tightly spaced tunnel. \n Carpal tunnel syndrome, also known as median nerve entrapment, occurs when swelling or irritation of the tendons in the carpal tunnel results in pressure on the median nerve causing pain in the palm side of the wrist and pain and tingling in the fingers. The median nerve controls sensations to the palm side of the thumb and fingers, as well as impulses to some small muscles in the hand that allow the fingers and thumb to move. \n Symptoms usually start gradually, with frequent burning, tingling, or numbness in the palm of the hand and the fingers, especially the index, middle and ring fingers. Pain can sometimes travel up the arm and affect the shoulder. The symptoms often first appear during the night. As symptoms worsen, people might feel pain, weakness, or numbness in the hand and wrist, radiating up the arm during the day. Decreased grip strength may make it difficult to form a fist, grasp small objects, or perform other manual tasks. If not properly treated, CTS can cause irreversible nerve damage and permanent deterioration of muscle tissue. \n From an Oriental medicine perspective, a repetitive stress injury is seen as a disruption of the flow of Qi and Blood (Xue) within the area and associated with cold, dampness or wind penetrating the muscles and sinews. Acupuncture points, stretching exercises, herbal remedies and nutritional supplements are chosen to treat accordingly. \n In addition to reducing the swelling, inflammation and pain, acupuncture addresses any headaches, neck pain, shoulder stiffness and sleeping problems that often accompany this condition. Your treatment may also take into account any underlying conditions that contribute to the development of RSI including posture, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid problems, diabetes, and hormonal changes of pregnancy and menopause. \n Managing repetitive stress injuries often requires some lifestyle changes, and it can take time to work out a strategy that works best for you. \n Here are a few minor changes you can implement to minimize stress on your hands and wrists: \n Shoulders and neck should be relaxed to open the chest and allow your head to float upwards without strain. When using a keyboard, wrists should be in a relaxed middle position and in a straight line with your forearms at elbow height or slightly lower.\nIf you or someone you know suffers from a repetitive stress injury, Call us today to learn more about how acupuncture and Oriental medicine can help you. \n Our society puts a premium on our waking hours and has the tendency to underestimate the importance of a full-night’s sleep. Often, good sleep hygiene is an afterthought for many people. Millions of people are besieged with insomnia and look for quick fixes instead of exploring the root causes of the problem. \n Evening is a time to allow our minds and bodies to turn inward to our subconscious. Excessive lighting at night, evening shift work, evening computing, video games, television and late-night eating all serve to counteract the body’s natural rhythms. It’s no wonder people have trouble sleeping. Exposure to early morning light and dusk helps to regulate sleep hormones in the body. Rather than embrace nighttime we tend to let our minds wander from one element of stress to another keeping us up for hours or perhaps an entire evening. We are then forced to approach the new day without having benefited from the regenerative powers that night time brings. \n In Oriental medicine sleep occurs when the yang energy of the day folds into Yin – nighttime. Yin energy of the body is cooling and restorative. It is the time of day when our bodies turn inward and regenerate. This is the time we dream and explore the caverns of our unconscious mind. Conversely, daytime is yang, which is expansive. We expend the energy we have built up from the process of sleeping. Together, this is the cycle of yin and yang. \n To apply the concept of yin and yang to your everyday life try eating your last meal at least three hours before going to bed. If you are a hot excess type, you can cool your body down by avoiding hot and spicy food and drink. Avoid alcohol, coffee, chocolate any other stimulants, especially late in the day. \n Help circulate your body’s energy by working out or by gentle exercising. Build your body’s nutritive aspect by eating marrow based soups and stews, dark pigmented vegetables and fruits. Avoid overworking or over rumination as well. \n Meditation is an invaluable tool to help your brain unwind. Helping the body create a sense of calm meditation can reduce stress, increase feelings of well-being, and improve overall health. It is of specific use to help one increase alertness, relaxation and reflection even in “waking” states. Meditation is best practiced during the day to help ease your sleep patterns at night. \n One contributor to insomnia, stress, weakens the function of the liver, which in turn affects the health of your nerves. Acupuncture and Oriental medicine have a calming effect on the nervous system clearing obstructions in the muscle and nerve channels, assisting the flow of oxygen-enriched energy and relaxing the system. Common noted benefits include deeper breathing, improved digestive abilities, better sleeping patterns, and a general sense of well being. \n Practicing good sleep hygiene and keeping your body in sync with the rhythm of day and night can help your body cope with sleep deprivation give it an opportunity to get stronger and heal. \n By implementing just a few of the following suggestions you should notice a great improvement in your sleep and how you function in the daylight hours. \n   \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you. Together we implement lasting changes that will improve your energy, balance and health.

From a Western perspective, we know that longans contain large amounts of Vitamin C and phenolic compounds, which may help to detoxify and protect the liver. \n Alternate Tasks – Avoid doing the same task for more than a couple of hours at a time and alternate between tasks that use different muscle groups where possible. Fatigue is a sign that you need to take a break. Take small breaks to gently stretch and bend your hands and wrists and readjust your position. \n Reduce Pressure – Many people use more force than needed to perform tasks involving their hands, which can increase pressure and cause irritation. Be mindful of the speed and amount of pressure used to perform tasks. Ease up, slow down, and grip using your palm or whole hand to distribute the load. If using tools such as riveters or jackhammers for extended periods, take frequent breaks or operate the tool at a speed that causes the least amount of vibration. \n Cultivate Good Posture – Incorrect posture can cause your shoulders to roll forward, shortening neck and shoulder muscles and compressing nerves in your neck, which can affect your wrists, hands, and fingers. \n Maintain a routine sleep schedule. \n Make your bedroom a sanctuary. \n Keep it dark, cool, and quiet. \n Establish a sense of safety with your surroundings. \n Reduce nicotine, caffeine and alcohol use. \n Avoid rigorous exercise 3-5 hours prior to bedtime. \n Avoid heavy meals near bedtime. \n Position clock away from the bed. \n Limit television and computer use to early evening.",

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n For most cultures across the globe, there are beauty constants such as clear skin, bright eyes, and shiny hair. Like calmness and strength, these outward features are universally attractive. While we work towards these qualities with regimens that may include exercise, meditation, or even using a nice shampoo, the foods we eat are key to achieving inner and outer beauty. \n In traditional Chinese medicine, foods are prescribed for their effects on organs, blood, yin, yang, and Qi, the major players in our physical and emotional health. Foods such as rice, seaweed, sweet potatoes, and bananas nourish our yin, which in turn hydrates and nourishes organs. Think of a parched plant; after a good watering it becomes more tumescent. Eating yin-enhancing foods nourishes the body in a way that simple drinking water cannot. \n Sweet black rice, when cooked with longan berries (euphoria longana) and Chinese dates, becomes a congee that nourishes blood and Qi. In the Chinese system of food cures, these three foods work together to enhance beauty and longevity. \n Sweet Rice Congee (Taken from Ancient Healing for Modern Women, by Dr. Xiolan Zhao, C.M.D.) \n Ingredients: \n   \n Instructions: \n In a large heavy saucepan, add 6 cups of water, black sweet rice, longan fruit, dates, and raw sugar. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat and simmer for two hours, stirring occasionally. Garnish with ginger. Makes four servings.\nNote: All ingredients are available at most Asian grocery stores. \n  \n Adding nutrient-rich super foods to the diet can give men a healthy boost. \n Here are just a few foods that can help maintain muscle mass, prevent prostate cancer, and more. \n Avocados\nAvocados are a good source of vitamin K, dietary fiber, vitamin B6, vitamin C, folate and copper.  Rich in potassium, avocados contain more of this nutrient than bananas.  Potassium is needed to regulate nerves, heartbeat and, especially, blood pressure.  An added bonus for men: Avocados inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells. \n Blackberries\nBlackberries are packed with Vitamin C, calcium and magnesium, with more than double the amounts than their popular cousin, the blueberry.  Vitamin C is a powerful stress reducer that can lower blood pressure and return cortisol levels to normal faster when taken during periods of stress.  Magnesium and calcium act together to help regulate the nerves and muscle tone. \n Too little magnesium in your diet can cause nerve cells to become over activated and can trigger muscular tension, soreness, spasms, cramps, and fatigue.  Blackberries also score high on the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) scale assesses the antioxidant content of food: the higher the score, the better the food’s ability to neutralize cell-damaging free radicals that lead to cancer. \n Spinach\nSpinach is one of the most nutrient-dense foods in existence.  Spinach can help protect against prostate cancer, reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke, lower blood pressure and strengthen muscles. \n Walnuts\nWhen it comes to their health benefits, walnuts are the king of nuts. Richer in heart-healthy omega-3s than salmon, loaded with more anti-oxidants than red wine, and packing half as much muscle-building protein as chicken, walnuts are one of the all time super foods. \n Yogurt\nEating yogurt that contains live bacterial cultures every day improves digestive health, boosts the immune system, provides protection against cancer and may help you live longer.   Not all yogurts are probiotic though, so make sure the label says “live and active cultures.” \n Let us custom-tailor a treatment plan that will best suit your individual needs so that you can feel better quickly and safely! \n  \n Acupuncture views nutrition in a complex light, through the application of Oriental medicine wisdom to dietary habits. In short, certain foods are considered too yang, or hot to eat in excess during the warmer months, while others are prized for their yin ability to cool the body. Overall, the goal is balance between the internal yin and yang of the body. \n A healthy, nutritional diet, good sleep and moderate exercise can keep your skin and physical form at its best. \n For healthy skin, be sure to integrate these foods into your diet: \n Carrots and Sweet Potatoes: \n Healthy skin is directly dependent on the amount of vitamin A in our diet. Vitamin A acts as an antioxidant to neutralize harmful elements in our skin, helping to prevent wrinkles, resist infection and maintain the skin’s elasticity. Some of the best sources of Vitamin A are vegetables that are deep orange in color. \n Blackberries, Blueberries, Strawberries, and Plums:  \n In a study recently published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, these four fruits weighed in with the highest “total antioxidant capacity” of any food.  The antioxidants and other phytochemicals in these fruits can protect cells from damage and disintegration, thus guarding against premature aging. \n Salmon, Walnuts, Olive Oil, and Flax Seed:  \n Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are responsible for skin repair, moisture content, and overall elasticity, but because the body cannot produce its own EFAs, they must be obtained through the diet. Fish, walnuts, and flax seed oil are among the best sources for omega 3 fatty acids. Eating good-quality olive oil helps keep skin lubricated and keeps it looking and feeling healthier overall. Which olive oils are the best for your skin? Those labeled “cold pressed,” “expeller processed,” or “extra virgin” are the least processed forms. As a result, they contain the highest levels of antioxidant substances. \n Whole Wheat Bread, Brown Rice, Turkey, Tuna and Brazil Nuts:  \n Selenium is an antioxidant mineral responsible for tissue elasticity and healthy skin. It may also play an important role in preventing skin cancer, as some recent studies are showing that skin damaged by the sun may suffer fewer consequences if selenium levels are high. \n Green Tea:  \n Green tea’s ability to slow down the development of some signs of aging is attributed to its high levels of polyphenols, which have been well-documented for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Green tea may help prevent or reduce the risk of skin cancer according to a study published recently in the Archives of Dermatology, which shows that whether taken orally or applied to the skin, green tea can reduce the risk of damage from ultraviolet light and thus reduce the risk of skin cancer. \n Water : \n  Hydration plays a key role in keeping skin cells healthy. It is essential to maintaining your skin’s elasticity and suppleness. Keeping cells hydrated helps cells move nutrients in and toxins out, which helps keep skin clean and clear. \n Let us help you to optimize your skin health! \n Acupuncture and Oriental medicine can be very effective at treating skin conditions. Treatments can provide quick relief for acute symptoms and significant and lasting relief from recurrent or chronic skin conditions. \n The skin reflects and reacts to imbalances within the body’s internal landscape and the effects of the environment.

Your treatment may also take into account any underlying conditions that contribute to the development of RSI including posture, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid problems, diabetes, and hormonal changes of pregnancy and menopause. \n Managing repetitive stress injuries often requires some lifestyle changes, and it can take time to work out a strategy that works best for you. \n Here are a few minor changes you can implement to minimize stress on your hands and wrists: \n Shoulders and neck should be relaxed to open the chest and allow your head to float upwards without strain. When using a keyboard, wrists should be in a relaxed middle position and in a straight line with your forearms at elbow height or slightly lower.\nIf you or someone you know suffers from a repetitive stress injury, Call us today to learn more about how acupuncture and Oriental medicine can help you. \n Our society puts a premium on our waking hours and has the tendency to underestimate the importance of a full-night’s sleep. Often, good sleep hygiene is an afterthought for many people. Millions of people are besieged with insomnia and look for quick fixes instead of exploring the root causes of the problem. \n Evening is a time to allow our minds and bodies to turn inward to our subconscious. Excessive lighting at night, evening shift work, evening computing, video games, television and late-night eating all serve to counteract the body’s natural rhythms. It’s no wonder people have trouble sleeping. Exposure to early morning light and dusk helps to regulate sleep hormones in the body. Rather than embrace nighttime we tend to let our minds wander from one element of stress to another keeping us up for hours or perhaps an entire evening. We are then forced to approach the new day without having benefited from the regenerative powers that night time brings. \n In Oriental medicine sleep occurs when the yang energy of the day folds into Yin – nighttime. Yin energy of the body is cooling and restorative. It is the time of day when our bodies turn inward and regenerate. This is the time we dream and explore the caverns of our unconscious mind. Conversely, daytime is yang, which is expansive. We expend the energy we have built up from the process of sleeping. Together, this is the cycle of yin and yang. \n To apply the concept of yin and yang to your everyday life try eating your last meal at least three hours before going to bed. If you are a hot excess type, you can cool your body down by avoiding hot and spicy food and drink. Avoid alcohol, coffee, chocolate any other stimulants, especially late in the day. \n Help circulate your body’s energy by working out or by gentle exercising. Build your body’s nutritive aspect by eating marrow based soups and stews, dark pigmented vegetables and fruits. Avoid overworking or over rumination as well. \n Meditation is an invaluable tool to help your brain unwind. Helping the body create a sense of calm meditation can reduce stress, increase feelings of well-being, and improve overall health. It is of specific use to help one increase alertness, relaxation and reflection even in “waking” states. Meditation is best practiced during the day to help ease your sleep patterns at night. \n One contributor to insomnia, stress, weakens the function of the liver, which in turn affects the health of your nerves. Acupuncture and Oriental medicine have a calming effect on the nervous system clearing obstructions in the muscle and nerve channels, assisting the flow of oxygen-enriched energy and relaxing the system. Common noted benefits include deeper breathing, improved digestive abilities, better sleeping patterns, and a general sense of well being. \n Practicing good sleep hygiene and keeping your body in sync with the rhythm of day and night can help your body cope with sleep deprivation give it an opportunity to get stronger and heal. \n By implementing just a few of the following suggestions you should notice a great improvement in your sleep and how you function in the daylight hours. \n   \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you. Together we implement lasting changes that will improve your energy, balance and health.

From a Western perspective, we know that longans contain large amounts of Vitamin C and phenolic compounds, which may help to detoxify and protect the liver. \n Alternate Tasks – Avoid doing the same task for more than a couple of hours at a time and alternate between tasks that use different muscle groups where possible. Fatigue is a sign that you need to take a break. Take small breaks to gently stretch and bend your hands and wrists and readjust your position. \n Reduce Pressure – Many people use more force than needed to perform tasks involving their hands, which can increase pressure and cause irritation. Be mindful of the speed and amount of pressure used to perform tasks. Ease up, slow down, and grip using your palm or whole hand to distribute the load. If using tools such as riveters or jackhammers for extended periods, take frequent breaks or operate the tool at a speed that causes the least amount of vibration. \n Cultivate Good Posture – Incorrect posture can cause your shoulders to roll forward, shortening neck and shoulder muscles and compressing nerves in your neck, which can affect your wrists, hands, and fingers. \n Maintain a routine sleep schedule. \n Make your bedroom a sanctuary. \n Keep it dark, cool, and quiet. \n Establish a sense of safety with your surroundings. \n Reduce nicotine, caffeine and alcohol use. \n Avoid rigorous exercise 3-5 hours prior to bedtime. \n Avoid heavy meals near bedtime. \n Position clock away from the bed. \n Limit television and computer use to early evening.",

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n  \n Adding nutrient-rich super foods to the diet can give men a healthy boost. \n Here are just a few foods that can help maintain muscle mass, prevent prostate cancer, and more. \n Avocados\nAvocados are a good source of vitamin K, dietary fiber, vitamin B6, vitamin C, folate and copper.  Rich in potassium, avocados contain more of this nutrient than bananas.  Potassium is needed to regulate nerves, heartbeat and, especially, blood pressure.  An added bonus for men: Avocados inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells. \n Blackberries\nBlackberries are packed with Vitamin C, calcium and magnesium, with more than double the amounts than their popular cousin, the blueberry.  Vitamin C is a powerful stress reducer that can lower blood pressure and return cortisol levels to normal faster when taken during periods of stress.  Magnesium and calcium act together to help regulate the nerves and muscle tone. \n Too little magnesium in your diet can cause nerve cells to become over activated and can trigger muscular tension, soreness, spasms, cramps, and fatigue.  Blackberries also score high on the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) scale assesses the antioxidant content of food: the higher the score, the better the food’s ability to neutralize cell-damaging free radicals that lead to cancer. \n Spinach\nSpinach is one of the most nutrient-dense foods in existence.  Spinach can help protect against prostate cancer, reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke, lower blood pressure and strengthen muscles. \n Walnuts\nWhen it comes to their health benefits, walnuts are the king of nuts. Richer in heart-healthy omega-3s than salmon, loaded with more anti-oxidants than red wine, and packing half as much muscle-building protein as chicken, walnuts are one of the all time super foods. \n Yogurt\nEating yogurt that contains live bacterial cultures every day improves digestive health, boosts the immune system, provides protection against cancer and may help you live longer.   Not all yogurts are probiotic though, so make sure the label says “live and active cultures.” \n Let us custom-tailor a treatment plan that will best suit your individual needs so that you can feel better quickly and safely! \n Name * \n Email * \n Website \n  \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n  \n Acupuncture views nutrition in a complex light, through the application of Oriental medicine wisdom to dietary habits. In short, certain foods are considered too yang, or hot to eat in excess during the warmer months, while others are prized for their yin ability to cool the body. Overall, the goal is balance between the internal yin and yang of the body. \n A healthy, nutritional diet, good sleep and moderate exercise can keep your skin and physical form at its best. \n For healthy skin, be sure to integrate these foods into your diet: \n Carrots and Sweet Potatoes: \n Healthy skin is directly dependent on the amount of vitamin A in our diet. Vitamin A acts as an antioxidant to neutralize harmful elements in our skin, helping to prevent wrinkles, resist infection and maintain the skin’s elasticity. Some of the best sources of Vitamin A are vegetables that are deep orange in color. \n Blackberries, Blueberries, Strawberries, and Plums:  \n In a study recently published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, these four fruits weighed in with the highest “total antioxidant capacity” of any food.  The antioxidants and other phytochemicals in these fruits can protect cells from damage and disintegration, thus guarding against premature aging. \n Salmon, Walnuts, Olive Oil, and Flax Seed:  \n Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are responsible for skin repair, moisture content, and overall elasticity, but because the body cannot produce its own EFAs, they must be obtained through the diet. Fish, walnuts, and flax seed oil are among the best sources for omega 3 fatty acids. Eating good-quality olive oil helps keep skin lubricated and keeps it looking and feeling healthier overall. Which olive oils are the best for your skin? Those labeled “cold pressed,” “expeller processed,” or “extra virgin” are the least processed forms. As a result, they contain the highest levels of antioxidant substances. \n Whole Wheat Bread, Brown Rice, Turkey, Tuna and Brazil Nuts:  \n Selenium is an antioxidant mineral responsible for tissue elasticity and healthy skin. It may also play an important role in preventing skin cancer, as some recent studies are showing that skin damaged by the sun may suffer fewer consequences if selenium levels are high. \n Green Tea:  \n Green tea’s ability to slow down the development of some signs of aging is attributed to its high levels of polyphenols, which have been well-documented for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Green tea may help prevent or reduce the risk of skin cancer according to a study published recently in the Archives of Dermatology, which shows that whether taken orally or applied to the skin, green tea can reduce the risk of damage from ultraviolet light and thus reduce the risk of skin cancer. \n Water : \n  Hydration plays a key role in keeping skin cells healthy. It is essential to maintaining your skin’s elasticity and suppleness. Keeping cells hydrated helps cells move nutrients in and toxins out, which helps keep skin clean and clear. \n Let us help you to optimize your skin health! \n Name * \n Email * \n Website \n  \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Acupuncture and Oriental medicine can be very effective at treating skin conditions. Treatments can provide quick relief for acute symptoms and significant and lasting relief from recurrent or chronic skin conditions. \n The skin reflects and reacts to imbalances within the body’s internal landscape and the effects of the environment. Internal disharmonies caused by strong emotions, diet, and your constitution, as well as environmental influences such as wind, dryness, dampness, and heat, can all contribute to the development of a skin disorder. To keep your skin healthy and beautiful on the outside, you must work on the inside of your body as well. Increasing the flow of energy, blood and lymph circulation improves the skin’s natural healthy color. \n Promotion of collagen production increases muscle tone and elasticity, helping to firm the skin. Stimulating the formation of body fluids nourishes the skin and encourages it to be moister, softer, smoother and more lustrous. \n General skin conditions that can be treated with acupuncture and Oriental medicine include acne, dermatitis, eczema, pruritus, psoriasis, rosacea, shingles and urticaria (hives). Oriental medicine does not recognize skin problems as one particular syndrome. Instead, it aims to treat the specific symptoms that are unique to each individual using a variety of techniques with acupuncture, such as herbal medicine, bodywork, lifestyle/dietary recommendations and energetic exercises to restore imbalances found in the body. Therefore, if 10 patients are treated with Oriental medicine for eczema, each patient will receive a unique, customized treatment with different lifestyle and dietary recommendations. \n If you suffer from a skin condition or would like to know how to optimize your skin health, Contact One Essence Healing to learn more about how acupuncture and Oriental medicine can help you. \n Name * \n Email * \n Website \n  \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you. Together we implement lasting changes that will improve your energy, balance and health.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n More than 95 million Americans suffer from digestive disorders ranging from constipation, diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome to more serious conditions such as acid reflux (GERD), ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. In fact, more than 35 million physician office visits a year are due to gastrointestinal complaints. Reports are confirming that acupuncture and Oriental medicine can offer relief from even the most complex digestive problems. \n Evidence that Oriental medicine has been used for digestive disorders can be found in early medical literature dating back to 3 AD, where specific acupuncture points and herbal formulas for borborygmus (rumbling or gurgling in the intestines), abdominal pain and diarrhea with pain are discussed. \n According to Oriental medical theory, most digestive disorders are due to disharmony in the spleen and stomach. The spleen plays a central part in the health and vitality of the body, taking a lead role in the assimilation of nutrients and maintenance of physical strength. It turns digested food from the stomach into usable nutrients and qi (energy). Many schools of thought have been formed around this organ; the premise being that the proper functioning of the”‘middle” is the key to all aspects of vitality. \n By taking into account a person’s constitution and varied symptoms, a treatment plan is designed specifically for the individual to bring their “middle” back into harmony and optimize the proper functioning of the digestive system. A variety of techniques can be used during treatment including acupuncture, lifestyle/dietary recommendations and energetic exercises to restore digestive health. \n Is your digestive system functioning as well as it could? Acupuncture and Oriental medicine are extremely effective at treating a wide array of digestive disorders.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Repetitive stress injuries (RSI) are the most common job-related injuries and are responsible for the highest number of days lost among all work related injuries. One of the most well-known types of repetitive stress injury, carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) accounts for over two million visits to physicians’ offices and approximately 465,000 carpal tunnel release operations each year, making it the most frequent surgery of the hand and wrist. \n Symptoms of repetitive stress injuries include tightness, stiffness, pain, tingling, numbness, coldness and loss of strength in the arm. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a repetitive stress injury that refers specifically to the inflammation of a specific ligament that puts pressure on the median nerve. \n Acupuncture is extremely effective for treating repetitive stress injuries including carpal tunnel syndrome; eliminating the need for surgery or the use of anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids. In fact, one of the most common reasons that people get acupuncture is for repetitive stress injuries. Recent studies even suggest that acupuncture may be more effective than corticosteroids when it comes to treating CTS. \n The carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway in the wrist made up of ligaments and bones. The median nerve and the tendons that connect the fingers to the muscles of the forearm pass through this tightly spaced tunnel. \n Carpal tunnel syndrome, also known as median nerve entrapment, occurs when swelling or irritation of the tendons in the carpal tunnel results in pressure on the median nerve causing pain in the palm side of the wrist and pain and tingling in the fingers. The median nerve controls sensations to the palm side of the thumb and fingers, as well as impulses to some small muscles in the hand that allow the fingers and thumb to move. \n Symptoms usually start gradually, with frequent burning, tingling, or numbness in the palm of the hand and the fingers, especially the index, middle and ring fingers. Pain can sometimes travel up the arm and affect the shoulder. The symptoms often first appear during the night. As symptoms worsen, people might feel pain, weakness, or numbness in the hand and wrist, radiating up the arm during the day. Decreased grip strength may make it difficult to form a fist, grasp small objects, or perform other manual tasks. If not properly treated, CTS can cause irreversible nerve damage and permanent deterioration of muscle tissue. \n From an Oriental medicine perspective, a repetitive stress injury is seen as a disruption of the flow of Qi and Blood (Xue) within the area and associated with cold, dampness or wind penetrating the muscles and sinews. Acupuncture points, stretching exercises, herbal remedies and nutritional supplements are chosen to treat accordingly. \n In addition to reducing the swelling, inflammation and pain, acupuncture addresses any headaches, neck pain, shoulder stiffness and sleeping problems that often accompany this condition. Your treatment may also take into account any underlying conditions that contribute to the development of RSI including posture, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid problems, diabetes, and hormonal changes of pregnancy and menopause. \n Managing repetitive stress injuries often requires some lifestyle changes, and it can take time to work out a strategy that works best for you. \n Here are a few minor changes you can implement to minimize stress on your hands and wrists: \n Shoulders and neck should be relaxed to open the chest and allow your head to float upwards without strain. When using a keyboard, wrists should be in a relaxed middle position and in a straight line with your forearms at elbow height or slightly lower.\nIf you or someone you know suffers from a repetitive stress injury, Call us today to learn more about how acupuncture and Oriental medicine can help you. \n Name * \n Email * \n Website \n  \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

Fatigue is a sign that you need to take a break. Take small breaks to gently stretch and bend your hands and wrists and readjust your position. \n Reduce Pressure – Many people use more force than needed to perform tasks involving their hands, which can increase pressure and cause irritation. Be mindful of the speed and amount of pressure used to perform tasks. Ease up, slow down, and grip using your palm or whole hand to distribute the load. If using tools such as riveters or jackhammers for extended periods, take frequent breaks or operate the tool at a speed that causes the least amount of vibration. \n Cultivate Good Posture – Incorrect posture can cause your shoulders to roll forward, shortening neck and shoulder muscles and compressing nerves in your neck, which can affect your wrists, hands, and fingers.",

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Our society puts a premium on our waking hours and has the tendency to underestimate the importance of a full-night’s sleep. Often, good sleep hygiene is an afterthought for many people. Millions of people are besieged with insomnia and look for quick fixes instead of exploring the root causes of the problem. \n Evening is a time to allow our minds and bodies to turn inward to our subconscious. Excessive lighting at night, evening shift work, evening computing, video games, television and late-night eating all serve to counteract the body’s natural rhythms. It’s no wonder people have trouble sleeping. Exposure to early morning light and dusk helps to regulate sleep hormones in the body. Rather than embrace nighttime we tend to let our minds wander from one element of stress to another keeping us up for hours or perhaps an entire evening. We are then forced to approach the new day without having benefited from the regenerative powers that night time brings. \n In Oriental medicine sleep occurs when the yang energy of the day folds into Yin – nighttime. Yin energy of the body is cooling and restorative. It is the time of day when our bodies turn inward and regenerate. This is the time we dream and explore the caverns of our unconscious mind. Conversely, daytime is yang, which is expansive. We expend the energy we have built up from the process of sleeping. Together, this is the cycle of yin and yang. \n To apply the concept of yin and yang to your everyday life try eating your last meal at least three hours before going to bed. If you are a hot excess type, you can cool your body down by avoiding hot and spicy food and drink. Avoid alcohol, coffee, chocolate any other stimulants, especially late in the day. \n Help circulate your body’s energy by working out or by gentle exercising. Build your body’s nutritive aspect by eating marrow based soups and stews, dark pigmented vegetables and fruits. Avoid overworking or over rumination as well. \n Meditation is an invaluable tool to help your brain unwind. Helping the body create a sense of calm meditation can reduce stress, increase feelings of well-being, and improve overall health. It is of specific use to help one increase alertness, relaxation and reflection even in “waking” states. Meditation is best practiced during the day to help ease your sleep patterns at night. \n One contributor to insomnia, stress, weakens the function of the liver, which in turn affects the health of your nerves. Acupuncture and Oriental medicine have a calming effect on the nervous system clearing obstructions in the muscle and nerve channels, assisting the flow of oxygen-enriched energy and relaxing the system. Common noted benefits include deeper breathing, improved digestive abilities, better sleeping patterns, and a general sense of well being. \n Practicing good sleep hygiene and keeping your body in sync with the rhythm of day and night can help your body cope with sleep deprivation give it an opportunity to get stronger and heal. \n By implementing just a few of the following suggestions you should notice a great improvement in your sleep and how you function in the daylight hours. \n   \n Name * \n Email * \n Website \n  \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Patients suffering TMJ (temporomandibular joint disorder) can find relief from acupuncture.  Research conducted at the Ribeirão Preto Dental School, São Paulo University in Brazil, found that after 3 months of acupuncture, patients with TMJ experienced significantly less pain, increased strength of their bite and decreased EMG activity of the masticatory muscles. \n Temporomandibular joint and muscle disorders (TMJ disorders) are problems or symptoms of the chewing muscles and joints that connect your lower jaw to your skull.  17 patients were studied using acupuncture points for TMJ.  EMG measures were acquired before and after the treatment. The data collected at rest, protrusion, left and right laterality, and clenching were normalized by maximum voluntary contraction. Maximal bite force in right and left molar regions were also measured. \n The researchers found decreased EMG activity at rest, protrusion, left and right laterality, and clenching; as well as increased values of maximal bite force after acupuncture treatment. \n The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine, 15 Issue 12: December 15, 2009 \n By: International Anesthesia Research Society (IARS) \n The scientific validity of traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of pain received a nod of support in the May issue of Anesthesia \u0026 Analgesia, official journal of the International Anesthesia Research Society (IARS). \n Dr. Philip Lang and colleagues of the University of Munich used quantitative sensory testing to identify changes in pain sensitivity with acupuncture in 24 healthy volunteers. After applying acupuncture to the leg, the researchers found that pain thresholds increased by up to 50 percent. Effects were noted in both the treated leg and the untreated (contralateral) leg. \n Quantitative sensory testing is used clinically to help physicians understand specific injuries in nerve fibers associated with chronic pain. It includes tests of both thermal perception (heat and cold), and mechanical perception (pressure applied to the skin). The patterns of response provide diagnostic information in patients with nerve injury regarding the type of nerve involved, and possible treatments. \n The results pointed to two nerve fibers—the “A delta” pain fibers and the “C” pain fibers—as being specifically affected by acupuncture. Although the effects were modest, the researchers believe they provide the basis for future studies in individuals with chronic pain, where the effects might be more dramatic. \n The study also supported the effects of three different forms of acupuncture: manual acupuncture needling alone and with the addition of high-frequency and low-frequency electrical stimulation. All treatments were performed by an experienced acupuncturist, applied to acupuncture points commonly used in pain management. \n The results provide a scientific background for the ancient practice of acupuncture, according to Dr. Dominik Irnich, Head of the Multidisciplinary Pain Centre, Department of Anesthesiology, University of Munich, and the study’s leading author. Additionally, Dr. Irnich notes, “Our results show that contralateral stimulation leads to a remarkable pain relief. This suggests that acupuncturists should needle contralaterally if the affected side is too painful or not accessible—for example, if the skin is injured or there is a dressing in place.” \n Dr. Steven L. Shafer, Editor-in-Chief of Anesthesia \u0026 Analgesia and Professor of Anesthesiology at Columbia University, views the results as an important preliminary finding. “Reproducible findings are the cornerstone of scientific inquiry,” Dr. Shafer comments. “The authors have clearly described their methodology, and their findings. If other laboratories can reproduce these results in properly controlled studies, then this provides further support for the scientific basis of acupuncture. Additionally, the ability of quantitative sensory testing to identify specific types of nerves involved in pain transmission may help direct research into the mechanism of acupuncture analgesia.” \n More than 45 million Americans (one in six) suffer from chronic headaches, 20 million of whom are women. Scientific research shows that acupuncture can be more effective than medication in reducing the severity and frequency of chronic headaches. \n The pain that headache and migraine sufferers endure can impact every aspect of their lives.  A widely accepted form of treatment for headaches, acupuncture can offer powerful relief without the side effects that prescription and over-the-counter drugs can cause. \n Headaches and migraines, as well as their underlying causes have been treated successfully with acupuncture and Oriental medicine for thousands of years.  Acupuncture and Oriental medicine can be used alone in the management and treatment of headaches, or as part of a comprehensive treatment program. \n Oriental Medicine does not recognize migraines and chronic headaches as one particular syndrome. Instead, it aims to treat the specific symptoms that are unique to each individual using a variety of of techniques such as acupuncture, tui-na massage, and energetic exercises to restore imbalances found in the body. Therefore, your diagnosis and treatment will depend on a number of variables including: \n Your answers to these questions will help your practitioner create a treatment plan specifically for you. The basic foundation for Oriental medicine is that there is a life energy flowing through the body which is termed Qi (pronounced chee). This energy flows through the body on channels known as meridians that connect all of our major organs.  According to Oriental medical theory, illness or pain arises when the cyclical flow of Qi in the meridians becomes unbalanced. Acupuncture stimulates specific points located on or near the surface of the skin to alter various biochemical and physiological conditions that cause aches and pains or illness. \n The length, number and frequency of treatments will vary. Typical treatments last from five to 30 minutes, with the patient being treated one or two times a week. Some headaches, migraines and related symptoms are relieved after the first treatment, while more severe or chronic ailments often require multiple treatments. \n Since the early seventies, studies around the globe have suggested that acupuncture is an effective treatment for migraines and headaches.  Researchers at Duke University Medical Center analyzed the results of more than 30 studies on acupuncture as a pain reliever for a variety of ailments, including chronic headaches. They found that acupuncture decreases pain with fewer side effects and can be less expensive than medication.  Researchers found that using acupuncture as an alternative for pain relief also reduced the need for post-operative pain medications. \n In a study published in the November 1999 issue of Cephalalgia, scientists evaluated the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of migraines and recurrent headaches by systematically reviewing 22 randomized controlled trials. A total of 1,042 patients were examined. It was found that headache and migraine sufferers experienced significantly more relief from acupuncture than patients who were administered “sham” acupuncture. \n A clinical observation, published in a 2002 edition of the Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine, studied 50 patients presenting with various types of headaches who were treated with scalp acupuncture. The results of this study showed that 98 percent of patients treated with scalp acupuncture experienced no headaches or only occasional, mild headaches in the six months following care. \n In a case study, published in the June 2003 Issue of Medical Acupuncture, doctors found that acupuncture resulted in the resolution or reduction in the frequency and severity of cluster headaches, and a decrease or discontinuation of pain medications. It was concluded that acupuncture can be used to provide sustained relief from cluster headaches and to stimulate the body’s natural production of adrenal cortisol to aid in discontinuing corticosteroids. \n According to the July 2005 issue of the British Medical Journal, a randomized controlled trial in Germany found that acupuncture cut tension headache rates almost in half.  Researchers divided 270 patients who reported similarly severe tension headaches into three groups for the study. Over the project’s eight-week period, one group received traditional acupuncture, one received only minimal acupuncture, and the third group received neither treatment. Those receiving the traditional acupuncture reported headache rates of nearly half that of those who received no treatments, suffering 7 fewer days of headaches. The minimal acupuncture group suffered 6.6 fewer days, and the non-acupuncture group suffered 1.5 fewer days.  The improvements continued for months after the treatments were concluded, rising slightly as time went on. \n Do you or someone you know suffer from headaches or migraines? \n More than 95 million Americans suffer from digestive disorders ranging from constipation, diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome to more serious conditions such as acid reflux (GERD), ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.  In fact, more than 35 million physician office visits a year are due to gastrointestinal complaints.  Reports are confirming that acupuncture and Oriental medicine can offer relief from even the most complex digestive problems. \n Evidence that Oriental medicine has been used for digestive disorders can be found in early medical literature dating back to 3 AD, where specific acupuncture points and herbal formulas for borborygmus (rumbling or gurgling in the intestines), abdominal pain and diarrhea with pain are discussed. \n According to Oriental medical theory, most digestive disorders are due to disharmony in the spleen and stomach. The spleen plays a central part in the health and vitality of the body, taking a lead role in the assimilation of nutrients and maintenance of physical strength. It turns digested food from the stomach into usable nutrients and qi (energy). Many schools of thought have been formed around this organ; the premise being that the proper functioning of the”‘middle” is the key to all aspects of vitality. \n By taking into account a person’s constitution and varied symptoms, a treatment plan is designed specifically for the individual to bring their “middle” back into harmony and optimize the proper functioning of the digestive system. A variety of techniques can be used during treatment including acupuncture, lifestyle/dietary recommendations and energetic exercises to restore digestive health. \n Is your digestive system functioning as well as it could? Acupuncture and Oriental medicine are extremely effective at treating a wide array of digestive disorders. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n By: International Anesthesia Research Society (IARS) \n The scientific validity of traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of pain received a nod of support in the May issue of Anesthesia \u0026 Analgesia, official journal of the International Anesthesia Research Society (IARS). \n Dr. Philip Lang and colleagues of the University of Munich used quantitative sensory testing to identify changes in pain sensitivity with acupuncture in 24 healthy volunteers. After applying acupuncture to the leg, the researchers found that pain thresholds increased by up to 50 percent. Effects were noted in both the treated leg and the untreated (contralateral) leg. \n Quantitative sensory testing is used clinically to help physicians understand specific injuries in nerve fibers associated with chronic pain. It includes tests of both thermal perception (heat and cold), and mechanical perception (pressure applied to the skin). The patterns of response provide diagnostic information in patients with nerve injury regarding the type of nerve involved, and possible treatments. \n The results pointed to two nerve fibers—the “A delta” pain fibers and the “C” pain fibers—as being specifically affected by acupuncture. Although the effects were modest, the researchers believe they provide the basis for future studies in individuals with chronic pain, where the effects might be more dramatic. \n The study also supported the effects of three different forms of acupuncture: manual acupuncture needling alone and with the addition of high-frequency and low-frequency electrical stimulation. All treatments were performed by an experienced acupuncturist, applied to acupuncture points commonly used in pain management. \n The results provide a scientific background for the ancient practice of acupuncture, according to Dr. Dominik Irnich, Head of the Multidisciplinary Pain Centre, Department of Anesthesiology, University of Munich, and the study’s leading author. Additionally, Dr. Irnich notes, “Our results show that contralateral stimulation leads to a remarkable pain relief. This suggests that acupuncturists should needle contralaterally if the affected side is too painful or not accessible—for example, if the skin is injured or there is a dressing in place.” \n Dr. Steven L. Shafer, Editor-in-Chief of Anesthesia \u0026 Analgesia and Professor of Anesthesiology at Columbia University, views the results as an important preliminary finding. “Reproducible findings are the cornerstone of scientific inquiry,” Dr. Shafer comments. “The authors have clearly described their methodology, and their findings. If other laboratories can reproduce these results in properly controlled studies, then this provides further support for the scientific basis of acupuncture. Additionally, the ability of quantitative sensory testing to identify specific types of nerves involved in pain transmission may help direct research into the mechanism of acupuncture analgesia.” \n Name * \n Email * \n Website \n  \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n More than 45 million Americans (one in six) suffer from chronic headaches, 20 million of whom are women. Scientific research shows that acupuncture can be more effective than medication in reducing the severity and frequency of chronic headaches. \n The pain that headache and migraine sufferers endure can impact every aspect of their lives.  A widely accepted form of treatment for headaches, acupuncture can offer powerful relief without the side effects that prescription and over-the-counter drugs can cause. \n Headaches and migraines, as well as their underlying causes have been treated successfully with acupuncture and Oriental medicine for thousands of years.  Acupuncture and Oriental medicine can be used alone in the management and treatment of headaches, or as part of a comprehensive treatment program. \n Oriental Medicine does not recognize migraines and chronic headaches as one particular syndrome. Instead, it aims to treat the specific symptoms that are unique to each individual using a variety of of techniques such as acupuncture, tui-na massage, and energetic exercises to restore imbalances found in the body. Therefore, your diagnosis and treatment will depend on a number of variables including: \n Your answers to these questions will help your practitioner create a treatment plan specifically for you. The basic foundation for Oriental medicine is that there is a life energy flowing through the body which is termed Qi (pronounced chee). This energy flows through the body on channels known as meridians that connect all of our major organs.  According to Oriental medical theory, illness or pain arises when the cyclical flow of Qi in the meridians becomes unbalanced. Acupuncture stimulates specific points located on or near the surface of the skin to alter various biochemical and physiological conditions that cause aches and pains or illness. \n The length, number and frequency of treatments will vary. Typical treatments last from five to 30 minutes, with the patient being treated one or two times a week. Some headaches, migraines and related symptoms are relieved after the first treatment, while more severe or chronic ailments often require multiple treatments. \n Since the early seventies, studies around the globe have suggested that acupuncture is an effective treatment for migraines and headaches.  Researchers at Duke University Medical Center analyzed the results of more than 30 studies on acupuncture as a pain reliever for a variety of ailments, including chronic headaches. They found that acupuncture decreases pain with fewer side effects and can be less expensive than medication.  Researchers found that using acupuncture as an alternative for pain relief also reduced the need for post-operative pain medications. \n In a study published in the November 1999 issue of Cephalalgia, scientists evaluated the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of migraines and recurrent headaches by systematically reviewing 22 randomized controlled trials. A total of 1,042 patients were examined. It was found that headache and migraine sufferers experienced significantly more relief from acupuncture than patients who were administered “sham” acupuncture. \n A clinical observation, published in a 2002 edition of the Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine, studied 50 patients presenting with various types of headaches who were treated with scalp acupuncture. The results of this study showed that 98 percent of patients treated with scalp acupuncture experienced no headaches or only occasional, mild headaches in the six months following care. \n In a case study, published in the June 2003 Issue of Medical Acupuncture, doctors found that acupuncture resulted in the resolution or reduction in the frequency and severity of cluster headaches, and a decrease or discontinuation of pain medications. It was concluded that acupuncture can be used to provide sustained relief from cluster headaches and to stimulate the body’s natural production of adrenal cortisol to aid in discontinuing corticosteroids. \n According to the July 2005 issue of the British Medical Journal, a randomized controlled trial in Germany found that acupuncture cut tension headache rates almost in half.  Researchers divided 270 patients who reported similarly severe tension headaches into three groups for the study. Over the project’s eight-week period, one group received traditional acupuncture, one received only minimal acupuncture, and the third group received neither treatment. Those receiving the traditional acupuncture reported headache rates of nearly half that of those who received no treatments, suffering 7 fewer days of headaches. The minimal acupuncture group suffered 6.6 fewer days, and the non-acupuncture group suffered 1.5 fewer days.  The improvements continued for months after the treatments were concluded, rising slightly as time went on. \n Do you or someone you know suffer from headaches or migraines? \n Name * \n Email * \n Website \n  \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n More than 95 million Americans suffer from digestive disorders ranging from constipation, diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome to more serious conditions such as acid reflux (GERD), ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.  In fact, more than 35 million physician office visits a year are due to gastrointestinal complaints.  Reports are confirming that acupuncture and Oriental medicine can offer relief from even the most complex digestive problems. \n Evidence that Oriental medicine has been used for digestive disorders can be found in early medical literature dating back to 3 AD, where specific acupuncture points and herbal formulas for borborygmus (rumbling or gurgling in the intestines), abdominal pain and diarrhea with pain are discussed. \n According to Oriental medical theory, most digestive disorders are due to disharmony in the spleen and stomach. The spleen plays a central part in the health and vitality of the body, taking a lead role in the assimilation of nutrients and maintenance of physical strength. It turns digested food from the stomach into usable nutrients and qi (energy). Many schools of thought have been formed around this organ; the premise being that the proper functioning of the”‘middle” is the key to all aspects of vitality. \n By taking into account a person’s constitution and varied symptoms, a treatment plan is designed specifically for the individual to bring their “middle” back into harmony and optimize the proper functioning of the digestive system. A variety of techniques can be used during treatment including acupuncture, lifestyle/dietary recommendations and energetic exercises to restore digestive health. \n Is your digestive system functioning as well as it could? Acupuncture and Oriental medicine are extremely effective at treating a wide array of digestive disorders. \n Name * \n Email * \n Website \n  \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.

  "inline_text": "One Essence Healing \n Patients suffering TMJ (temporomandibular joint disorder) can find relief from acupuncture.  Research conducted at the Ribeirão Preto Dental School, São Paulo University in Brazil, found that after 3 months of acupuncture, patients with TMJ experienced significantly less pain, increased strength of their bite and decreased EMG activity of the masticatory muscles. \n Temporomandibular joint and muscle disorders (TMJ disorders) are problems or symptoms of the chewing muscles and joints that connect your lower jaw to your skull.  17 patients were studied using acupuncture points for TMJ.  EMG measures were acquired before and after the treatment. The data collected at rest, protrusion, left and right laterality, and clenching were normalized by maximum voluntary contraction. Maximal bite force in right and left molar regions were also measured. \n The researchers found decreased EMG activity at rest, protrusion, left and right laterality, and clenching; as well as increased values of maximal bite force after acupuncture treatment. \n The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine, 15 Issue 12: December 15, 2009 \n By: International Anesthesia Research Society (IARS) \n The scientific validity of traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of pain received a nod of support in the May issue of Anesthesia \u0026 Analgesia, official journal of the International Anesthesia Research Society (IARS). \n Dr. Philip Lang and colleagues of the University of Munich used quantitative sensory testing to identify changes in pain sensitivity with acupuncture in 24 healthy volunteers. After applying acupuncture to the leg, the researchers found that pain thresholds increased by up to 50 percent. Effects were noted in both the treated leg and the untreated (contralateral) leg. \n Quantitative sensory testing is used clinically to help physicians understand specific injuries in nerve fibers associated with chronic pain. It includes tests of both thermal perception (heat and cold), and mechanical perception (pressure applied to the skin). The patterns of response provide diagnostic information in patients with nerve injury regarding the type of nerve involved, and possible treatments. \n The results pointed to two nerve fibers—the “A delta” pain fibers and the “C” pain fibers—as being specifically affected by acupuncture. Although the effects were modest, the researchers believe they provide the basis for future studies in individuals with chronic pain, where the effects might be more dramatic. \n The study also supported the effects of three different forms of acupuncture: manual acupuncture needling alone and with the addition of high-frequency and low-frequency electrical stimulation. All treatments were performed by an experienced acupuncturist, applied to acupuncture points commonly used in pain management. \n The results provide a scientific background for the ancient practice of acupuncture, according to Dr. Dominik Irnich, Head of the Multidisciplinary Pain Centre, Department of Anesthesiology, University of Munich, and the study’s leading author. Additionally, Dr. Irnich notes, “Our results show that contralateral stimulation leads to a remarkable pain relief. This suggests that acupuncturists should needle contralaterally if the affected side is too painful or not accessible—for example, if the skin is injured or there is a dressing in place.” \n Dr. Steven L. Shafer, Editor-in-Chief of Anesthesia \u0026 Analgesia and Professor of Anesthesiology at Columbia University, views the results as an important preliminary finding. “Reproducible findings are the cornerstone of scientific inquiry,” Dr. Shafer comments. “The authors have clearly described their methodology, and their findings. If other laboratories can reproduce these results in properly controlled studies, then this provides further support for the scientific basis of acupuncture. Additionally, the ability of quantitative sensory testing to identify specific types of nerves involved in pain transmission may help direct research into the mechanism of acupuncture analgesia.” \n More than 45 million Americans (one in six) suffer from chronic headaches, 20 million of whom are women. Scientific research shows that acupuncture can be more effective than medication in reducing the severity and frequency of chronic headaches. \n The pain that headache and migraine sufferers endure can impact every aspect of their lives.  A widely accepted form of treatment for headaches, acupuncture can offer powerful relief without the side effects that prescription and over-the-counter drugs can cause. \n Headaches and migraines, as well as their underlying causes have been treated successfully with acupuncture and Oriental medicine for thousands of years.  Acupuncture and Oriental medicine can be used alone in the management and treatment of headaches, or as part of a comprehensive treatment program. \n Oriental Medicine does not recognize migraines and chronic headaches as one particular syndrome. Instead, it aims to treat the specific symptoms that are unique to each individual using a variety of of techniques such as acupuncture, tui-na massage, and energetic exercises to restore imbalances found in the body. Therefore, your diagnosis and treatment will depend on a number of variables including: \n Your answers to these questions will help your practitioner create a treatment plan specifically for you. The basic foundation for Oriental medicine is that there is a life energy flowing through the body which is termed Qi (pronounced chee). This energy flows through the body on channels known as meridians that connect all of our major organs.  According to Oriental medical theory, illness or pain arises when the cyclical flow of Qi in the meridians becomes unbalanced. Acupuncture stimulates specific points located on or near the surface of the skin to alter various biochemical and physiological conditions that cause aches and pains or illness. \n The length, number and frequency of treatments will vary. Typical treatments last from five to 30 minutes, with the patient being treated one or two times a week. Some headaches, migraines and related symptoms are relieved after the first treatment, while more severe or chronic ailments often require multiple treatments. \n Since the early seventies, studies around the globe have suggested that acupuncture is an effective treatment for migraines and headaches.  Researchers at Duke University Medical Center analyzed the results of more than 30 studies on acupuncture as a pain reliever for a variety of ailments, including chronic headaches. They found that acupuncture decreases pain with fewer side effects and can be less expensive than medication.  Researchers found that using acupuncture as an alternative for pain relief also reduced the need for post-operative pain medications. \n In a study published in the November 1999 issue of Cephalalgia, scientists evaluated the effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of migraines and recurrent headaches by systematically reviewing 22 randomized controlled trials. A total of 1,042 patients were examined. It was found that headache and migraine sufferers experienced significantly more relief from acupuncture than patients who were administered “sham” acupuncture. \n A clinical observation, published in a 2002 edition of the Journal of Traditional Chinese Medicine, studied 50 patients presenting with various types of headaches who were treated with scalp acupuncture. The results of this study showed that 98 percent of patients treated with scalp acupuncture experienced no headaches or only occasional, mild headaches in the six months following care. \n In a case study, published in the June 2003 Issue of Medical Acupuncture, doctors found that acupuncture resulted in the resolution or reduction in the frequency and severity of cluster headaches, and a decrease or discontinuation of pain medications. It was concluded that acupuncture can be used to provide sustained relief from cluster headaches and to stimulate the body’s natural production of adrenal cortisol to aid in discontinuing corticosteroids. \n According to the July 2005 issue of the British Medical Journal, a randomized controlled trial in Germany found that acupuncture cut tension headache rates almost in half.  Researchers divided 270 patients who reported similarly severe tension headaches into three groups for the study. Over the project’s eight-week period, one group received traditional acupuncture, one received only minimal acupuncture, and the third group received neither treatment. Those receiving the traditional acupuncture reported headache rates of nearly half that of those who received no treatments, suffering 7 fewer days of headaches. The minimal acupuncture group suffered 6.6 fewer days, and the non-acupuncture group suffered 1.5 fewer days.  The improvements continued for months after the treatments were concluded, rising slightly as time went on. \n Do you or someone you know suffer from headaches or migraines? \n More than 95 million Americans suffer from digestive disorders ranging from constipation, diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome to more serious conditions such as acid reflux (GERD), ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.  In fact, more than 35 million physician office visits a year are due to gastrointestinal complaints.  Reports are confirming that acupuncture and Oriental medicine can offer relief from even the most complex digestive problems. \n Evidence that Oriental medicine has been used for digestive disorders can be found in early medical literature dating back to 3 AD, where specific acupuncture points and herbal formulas for borborygmus (rumbling or gurgling in the intestines), abdominal pain and diarrhea with pain are discussed. \n According to Oriental medical theory, most digestive disorders are due to disharmony in the spleen and stomach. The spleen plays a central part in the health and vitality of the body, taking a lead role in the assimilation of nutrients and maintenance of physical strength. It turns digested food from the stomach into usable nutrients and qi (energy). Many schools of thought have been formed around this organ; the premise being that the proper functioning of the”‘middle” is the key to all aspects of vitality. \n By taking into account a person’s constitution and varied symptoms, a treatment plan is designed specifically for the individual to bring their “middle” back into harmony and optimize the proper functioning of the digestive system. A variety of techniques can be used during treatment including acupuncture, lifestyle/dietary recommendations and energetic exercises to restore digestive health. \n Is your digestive system functioning as well as it could? Acupuncture and Oriental medicine are extremely effective at treating a wide array of digestive disorders. \n  \n I'm a Doctor of Oriental Medicine and a Licensed Acupuncturist who not only treats your body but helps you find a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for you.
