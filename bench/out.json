  "inline_text": "I started July with 204 unread books sitting around my house.  And I ended with … *drumroll* …203! Yay! I did some traveling in July, which is always iffy for reading – sometimes I’m able to spend whole plane rides absorbed in a book and spend my vacation downtime reading, but other times I’m busy with all of my anti-anxiety flying tricks (mostly knitting) and can’t stay focused on a book, and have too much scheduled on my vacation to have much leisure reading time. Unfortunately, this year’s trip was more of the latter, but I still managed to get a decent bit read! (Especially considering that The Luminaries took me a month to read just by itself. That thing is a brick.) \n …anyways, let’s take a look at the breakdown: \n Audiobooks\n– War Storm by Victoria Aveyard\n– Justice Hall by Laurie R. King\n– Hidden Figures: The Untold True Story of Four African-American Women Who Helped Launch our Nature Into Space by Margot Lee Shetterly  (reviews coming soon)\n     \n Read But Not Owned\n– Mighty Jack by Ben Hatke\n– Zita the Spacegirl by Ben Hatke\n– Gun Machine by Warren Ellis  (reviews coming soon) \n Re-Reads\n      – Voyager by Diana Gabaldon\n     \n Read from my TBR pile (huzzah!)\n      – The Luminaries by Eleanor Catton  (review coming soon)\n     \n © 2018 Fyrefly’s Book Blog.

Let’s not think about the state of my to-do list; let’s look at some of my reading stats instead, shall we? \n  \n You can calculate these kind of stats for yourself using my reading tracking spreadsheet. You can download the 2014 version here: 2014 reading tracking spreadsheet; just change the tabs for 2018. You can find the instructions for using it here: reading tracking spreadsheet instructions. \n Here are my picks-of-the-month for the year! (Among my new books – picking books that I already loved enough to re-read as my favorite of the month just doesn’t seem fair.)\n   Read more… \n I started June with 205 unread books sitting around my house.  And I ended with … *drumroll* …204! June was a pretty good month, y’all! Not much clearance from the TBR pile, but some, and a fair bit of reading overall, enough to get me back on track for my yearly goals. \n …anyways, let’s take a look at the breakdown: \n Audiobooks\n      – King’s Cage by Victoria Aveyard (review coming soon)\n     \n Read But Not Owned (Books)\n      – Simon vs. the Homo sapiens Agenda by Becky Albertalli \n      – The Burning Maze by Rick Riordan (reviews coming soon) \n Read But Not Owned (Graphic Novels)\n      – Paper Girls, Vol. 3 by Brian K. Vaughan\n– Paper Girls, Vol. 4 by Brian K. Vaughan\n– The Wicked \u0026 the Divine, Vol. 6: Imperial Phase II by Kieron Gillen \n– Mighty Jack and the Goblin King by Ben Hatke\n(reviews coming soon)\n     \n E-books\n      – Mr. Darcy’s Diary by Amanda Grange (review coming soon) \n Re-Reads\n– Paper Girls, Vol. 2 by Brian K. Vaughan\n      – The Voyage of the Dawn Treader by C. S. Lewis\n– The Wicked \u0026 the Divine, Vol. 5: Imperial Phase I by Kieron Gillen \n     \n Read from my TBR pile (huzzah!)\n      – The Day the Angels Fell by Shawn Smucker (review coming soon) \n © 2018 Fyrefly’s Book Blog.

If you’re reading this on a site other than Fyrefly’s Book Blog or its RSS feed, be aware that this post has been stolen and is being used without permission. \n I started May with 204 unread books sitting around my house.  And I ended with … *drumroll* …205! Not bad! It takes me a while to get back into a reading groove after a busy semester, especially with paper books, but overall May treated me pretty darn well! \n …anyways, let’s take a look at the breakdown: \n Audiobooks\n– The Unpleasantness at Baskerville Hall by Chris Dolley\n– O Jerusalem by Laurie R. King\n– Head On by John Scalzi (reviews coming soon)\n     \n Read But Not Owned (Books)\n      – The Taliban Shuffle: Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan by Kim Barker\n    – Valerian: The Complete Collection, Volume 1 by Pierre Christin (reviews coming soon) \n Re-Reads\n      – A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L’Engle\n     \n © 2018 Fyrefly’s Book Blog.

And I ended with … *drumroll* …204! It was a long semester, and April was a loooong month. But I survived! (And have spent most of May recuperating.) \n …anyways, let’s take a look at the breakdown: \n Audiobooks\n      – The Scarlet Pimpernel by Baroness Emmuska Orczy\n      – I Know I Am But What Are You? by Samantha Bee (reviews coming soon)\n     \n Read But Not Owned (Books)\n      – La Belle Sauvage by Phillip Pullman (review coming soon)\n     \n Re-Reads\n      – Persuasion by Jane Austen\n     \n Read from my TBR pile (huzzah!)\n      – On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection by Charles Darwin \n (Technically not part of my TBR count, so my numbers didn’t go down, but I did already own it, so it sort of half counts?)\n     \n  \n © 2018 Fyrefly’s Book Blog.

If you’re reading this on a site other than Fyrefly’s Book Blog or its RSS feed, be aware that this post has been stolen and is being used without permission. \n I started March with 205 unread books sitting around my house.  And I ended with … *drumroll* …204! March was a pretty good month, reading-wise, although only one of the books I read was off my TBR shelf. I got the chance to take a short vacation this month, so travel time always helps with the reading. Plus I’m in the middle of quite a lot of books (more than usual, anyways), so I should be able to knock out a fair few in April. \n …anyways, let’s take a look at the breakdown: \n Audiobooks\n      – The Girl Who Drank the Moon by Kelly Barnhill* (review coming soon)\n     \n Read But Not Owned (Books)\n    – As the Crow Flies by Melanie Gillman\n    – The Grave’s a Fine and Private Place by Alan Bradley\n    – Pashmina by Nidhi Chanani   \n    – Wires and Nerve, Vol. 1 by Marissa Meyer\n    – Wires and Nerve, Vol. 2: Gone Rogue by Marissa Meyer (reviews coming soon) \n Re-Reads\n      – Lock In by John Scalzi\n     \n Read from my TBR pile (huzzah!)\n      – Longbourn by Jo Baker (review coming soon)   \n © 2018 Fyrefly’s Book Blog.

And I ended with … *drumroll* …205! I’m pretty happy with this month; I didn’t spend quite as much time as I’d wanted reading print (non-graphic-novel) books, but I got through a few, and any month that decreases the TBR pile is a good month. \n …anyways, let’s take a look at the breakdown: \n Audiobooks\n      – Ha’Penny by Jo Walton\n      – Wicked Plants: The Weed that Killed Lincoln’s Mother and Other Botanical Atrocities by Amy Stewart (reviews coming soon)\n     \n Read But Not Owned (Books)\n      – The Adventures of Superhero Girl by Faith Erin Hicks\n      – French Milk by Lucy Knisley (reviews coming soon) \n Re-Reads\n      – Rat Queens, Vol. 3: Demons by Kurtis J.

And I ended with … *drumroll* …208! Not too shabby! I managed to read more than I usually do at the start of a new semester, and I’ve been very good about not acquiring new books, so that’s something. \n …anyways, let’s take a look at the breakdown: \n Audiobooks\n      – The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas\n      – The Pearl Thief by Elizabeth Wein (reviews coming soon)\n     \n Re-Reads\n– Saga, Vol. 6  by Brian K.

And I ended with … *drumroll* …209! The holidays are always hectic but I managed to get a fair bit read anyways. Didn’t get any books for Christmas other than a cookbook, though, although that’s probably for the best. I did acquire a fair number of ebooks and audiobooks, though. I can’t be good all the time! \n …anyways, let’s take a look at the breakdown: \n Audiobooks\n– Ruin and Rising by Leigh Bardugo\n– The Paper Magician by Charlie N.

And I ended with … *drumroll* …210! I had houseguests for a large chunk of the month, and I never get much reading done when I’ve got houseguests – there’s always something else to be doing, or else I feel weird reading (or having my earbuds in for listening) instead of being social. So it was a pretty sparse month, reading-wise. But at least I was good about not acquiring more (physical) books. \n …anyways, let’s take a look at the breakdown: \n Audiobooks\n      – Locke and Key by Joe Hill (review coming soon)\n     \n Re-Reads\n      – Locke \u0026 Key Vol. 1: Welcome to Lovecraft by Joe Hill\n      – A Little Princess by Francis Hodgson Burnett\n     \n Read from my TBR pile (huzzah!)\n      – The Miniaturist by Jessie Burton (review coming soon)\n     \n  \n © 2017 Fyrefly’s Book Blog.

The remaining 35 were audiobooks, with a total of 16.39 days of listening time. (Not included in either of those tallies are all the individual short stories I read and/or listened to.) If you count the text equivalent of the audiobooks, I consumed 29,122 pages of reading material this year. \n I read books by 53 different authors, about 45% of which were new to me. My gender split was pretty good; 42 of the books I read were by men, and 40 were by women. \n I didn’t do a great job of reading my own books this year (new books, anyways, I re-read a bunch of my own books). Of the new books I read, only 26% came from my TBR pile. Another 38% were audiobooks, 31% were  from the library, and the remaining 5% were e-books freebies or from the eTBR “pile”. \n I was pretty good about not acquiring new books! I only added 13 books to my TBR pile – which is BY FAR the lowest its ever been since I’ve been keeping track. I only read 10 books from the pile ,but I cleared another 7 when I moved, leaving me with a net change of -4 TBR books! \n Of the books I read from my TBR pile, the average length of time between when I acquired them and when I finished them was 381 days. \n About a third of the new books I read were published in 2016 or 2017, but another third were from the 1990s, so the average publication date of my books was 2008. \n Unsurprisingly, about  half the books I read this year were fantasy; with historical fiction taking up another 18%, science fiction and non-fiction coming in at 9% each, and mysteries, contemporary fiction, and classics accounting for the rest.  \n About 41% of the books I read were young adult or mid-grade. \n Welcome to Fyrefly’s Book Blog!\t\t\tCome on in, read some reviews, drop me a comment, and let's talk books!\n\nIf you are a publisher or author interested in having me review your book, please check out my review policy, and then e-mail me at fyrefly98 AT gmail DOT com.\n\nLooking for the Book Blogs search engine?

  "inline_text": "Hey y’all things are moving forward well for us here at the Fyresyde Kitchen and because of that we are launching a website and moving the blog over to our own domain.  Come on over to the new place and keep up with our journey into principled eating. \n You can find us HERE! \n Posted in Uncategorized\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n A few weeks back my wife and I had a conversation regarding the difference of living a life of faith versus living a life of fear.  One thought that came from our discussion was that a life of fear is a life where a person is in constant distress about what might happen.  \n Fear is such a destructive power.  Fear has the power to destroy men, it destroys their self-esteem, it destroys their courage, it destroys their faith.  \n  For those that consider themselves faithful Christians fear should be viewed as a sin.  For it is said in the scriptures that fear and faith can not abide together and so every time that we go into fear we are turning our hearts, might, minds, and strength away for the service of the Lord God and we begin to serve ourselves and our idols. \n  But fear is a double edged sword of deception, it can define itself as a state of agitation and anxiety or it can also be characterized as a state of awe and reverence.   Such nuances in labels may confuse those valiant disciples trying to navigate life’s waters everyday.  How do you fear God and have faith?  How do you keep faith in the face of adversity? \n  The scriptures give us many examples of faithful men and women who gave no heed to their fears and rejoiced in the glory of their God with faith.  David was such a one.  When David came to the camp of the army of Israel to see what progress there was in the war against the Philistines he learned of the champion of  the Philistines, Goliath, and of the fear that the soldiers of Israel had for this man.  David was shocked.  “Who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?” (1Sam. 17:26) he asked of the fearful men.  He asked the same question of Saul the king. \n As we all know David was sent to battle this giant of a man and with the faith and courage of God he “hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine” (1Sam 17:48) and by the grace of God and with a sling and a single stone he overcame the fear of an entire army. \n  The scriptures also tell us a story of a man of great faith who after much tribulation found himself living a life of fear.  Job was an “upright” man who gave heed to the righteous side of fear, that is he held his God in great awe and reverence.  But one day the Lord gave leave to Satan to tempt , to try, and to afflict Job in his life. \n  Though Job never cursed the Lord during this time as we continue in the story we find that Job is living a life of fear.  “For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.  I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.”  It was Job’s friends who came to his aid.  Reminding him of the good he had done.  Telling them how he, Job, had been a forger of their own testimonies.  \n  But fear is a paralyzer of souls and a thief of power and it would prove to be sometime before Job would gain full recovery from this debilitating bout of fear.  He would, in fact, get to the point of being weary of his own life. \n  Fear is a deadly serpent whose venom is doubt and anger; hopelessness and grief.  If we are going to live the lives of abundance and grace that the Lord promises us we have got to live our lives in faith.  We have to rise every morning and immediately fill her hearts with joyful expressions and faithful thoughts. \n  We must remember the words of Harry Emerson Fosdick: \n Fear imprisons, faith liberates; fear paralyzes, faith empowers; fear disheartens, faith encourages; fear sickens, faith heals; fear makes useless, faith makes serviceable and, most of all,  fear puts hopelessness at the heart of life, while faith rejoices in its God.” \n Posted in devotional, Faith\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: abundance, Faith, fear, grace, Hope, joy, obstacles\t\t\t\t\t \n No one said it would be easy. \n Dear friends, if you are not extremely upset by the appalling amount of added sugar sitting on the shelves of your grocery store then you are not reading food labels before you purchase.  Sugar, corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, evaporated cane juice, etc.  The list of disguises that sugar wears on a food label is astounding.  One of my favorite things to see on a label now is organic [insert added sugar item here].  I wonder if Robert Kenner (Food, Inc.) will expose these imposters of health food store shelves.  Just because it’s organic sugar doesn’t mean it’s not still sugar. \n In my quest to eat sugar-free [and flour-free when I can] there have definitely been ups and downs.  First of all, let me reiterate that sugar is addictive.  If you don’t believe me I challenge you to remove all added sugar from your diet.  This means don’t eat fruit because it has sugar or anything like that, a balanced diet is still important, I am talking about reading a label and if it has the word sugar or any of it’s devilish disguises listed put it back on the shelf.  This means certain brands of ground turkey stay at the store.  This means you need to find sugar-free recipes for many of your favorite condiments including, ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise and barbecue sauce. \n All-in-all I believe that I am doing well becoming a sugar-free chef.  It is definitely not something that has or will happen overnight.  I have found that the aftertaste and “cotton mouth” that I once ignored when consuming sugar-free foods is now not a sensation I’m willing to have everyday.  So I’ve looked at a number of alternatives in the sweetener realm.  Also, in the past I used sugar as a stress reliever.  This is currently my biggest obstacle personally in becoming sugar-free.  When stressful times come I crave a Maple Bar or and orange soda.  Fat free, Sugar Free ice cream has come in handy in this area.  But I’m still trying to find a “sweet” carry along that I find palatable that I can reach for when life gets stupid. \n Of course, my job, for now, prohibits me from going 100% sugar-free.  Especially on the days when we are developing new product or testing new recipes. It’s hard for others to be confident when you tell them that something tastes good if you haven’t actually tasted it before.  Other than that, however, I am still well on my way to becoming a 100% added sugar-free chef. \n As always I invite you to remove added sugar from your diet and to leave your comments regarding your ups and downs.  We can all use a little encouragement. \n Posted in Food, Sugar Free Cooking\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: addiction, Cooking, diet, Food, sugar-free\t\t\t\t\t \n All foods are not created equal!  \n Below are ten power packed foods designed to give you energy, vitality and all around good health! Try these super foods to get started on the right foot.   \n  1. Beans – Beans of all kinds (kidney, navy, lentils, chickpeas, Northern) are high in plant protein and low in fat, carbs and calories.  If fiber is a problem in your diet, eating a healthy portion of beans each day can keep your digestive system healthy. \n  2. Oatmeal – Oatmeal is a filling grain that also provides much needed fiber to keep hunger at bay and your blood sugar constant. \n  3. Fruits – Fruits are filled with antioxidants such as Vitamin C and A.  Antioxidants fight free radical damage in the body and reduce the risk of cancer.  The antioxidants in fruit boost the immune system to fight the effects of aging in the body. \n  4. Allium foods – This class of foods includes garlic, onions, leeks and shallots.  Allium vegetables help guard the body against the risk of cancer and many other ailments and some are known for lowering cholesterol.  They also help lower blood pressure and prevent blood clots.  Eating these power packed vegetables in their natural state especially garlic increases their health benefits.  \n  5. Salmon – Salmon is rich in protein and in omega-3 fatty acids which reduces the risk of heart disease and other conditions. Wild salmon is a fatty fish but it contains good fats proven to improve health in children and adults.  \n  6. Flax seed – Like salmon it contains omega-3 fatty acids.  These seeds also contain omega-6 and omega-9 fatty acids.  You get a lot of power to fight high cholesterol, heart disease and diabetes with this seed.  \n  7. Peppers – Peppers contain antioxidants like beta-carotene and Vitamin C.  Peppers range from mild and sweet to so hot you’ll be calling the fire department.  All peppers contain a substance called capsaicin.  Capsaicin has the properties of an anti-inflammatory, a pain reliever, lowers cancer risk and heart disease.  \n  8. Nuts and seeds – Nuts are high in fat but those fats are the good kind.  Peanuts, almonds, Brazil nuts, walnuts and pistachios are all providers of good fats and protein.  Nuts help to lower cholesterol.  Eat them right out of the shell with no additives. \n  9. Açai – This berry has become the media darling of the health and food industry as of late.  It is rich in antioxidants and increases energy.  You can get more done and look better while doing it.  \n 10. Yogurt – The fat free variety is good for you.  Yogurt contains calcium, Vitamin B, and protein.  If you don’t drink milk, yogurt is an alternative to get your calcium in to build strong bones and teeth.  Live yogurt also contains friendly bacteria to help promote a healthy digestive system. \n Okay so perhaps you won’t grow rich from eating a healthier diet.  However, building a better healthier body begins with what you eat and if you are choosing and eating the right foods perhaps one day you will wake up and find yourself on the cover of a magazine, your quality of your life improved as well as your life expectancy, therefore giving you more time to work on becoming rich, So maybe you can Eat and Grow Rich.  There is only one way to find out.   How about oat crusted salmon with a fennel and leek white bean stew for dinner? \n Posted in Uncategorized\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n As this father’s day approaches I have been doing a lot of thinking in regards to my own father.  My father, as a father, was flawed.  He could be judgemental and suspicious, harassing and sarky.  He was never emotional and if I had a perfect memory I probably could count on one hand the number of times he’s said I love you.  And growing up we had a tense relationship.   \n Fast forward the clock several years and here I am a father in my own right and it is so clear to me what it was my father tried to do for me.  I understand the frustrations a father feels when he feels like he can’t provide something of beneficial value to his children when they need it.  I know the deep soul wrenching agony to feel like you have let your family down.  I know the fear that despite all that you do you will lose one or all of your children to the world or death. \n My wife asked me the other day what I thought my father’s legacy would be when he died.  My response was “work hard and never give up.”  Trying to live up to that standard bar has often been a cilice in my adult life that at times pushes me ever forward with diligence and perseverance and at times has brought me to my knees in shame for falling so short of the mark.   \n One of my earliest memories of my father is so vivid and yet so disconnected that I have never figured out how much was dream and how much really happened.  When my father was working in the oil field he use to share with me his hopes of owning his own company some day.  I have a vivid memory that I am certain was a dream of my father showing me a garage full of vehicles that were going to be for his business.  Later in life my father planned less for this opportunity and focused more on others but the damage was done from that time forward I have been obsessed with the idea of owning my own business.  My obsession is deepend because I often wonder if my father had to forgo his dream in order to more reliably provide for his family.  This thought is one of the driving forces in my life – I want to succeed big enough for us both. \n One last memory to share about my father, though there are many that  I could share.  In 1994 my father drove me from Wyoming to Las Cruces, New Mexico where I attended New Mexico State University for a semester.  After helping me check in and move in my father shook my hand, gave me a hug, and began to cry.  At the time I think we were both a little embarrased in the moment and I remember after we parted ways I myself teared up and was frustrated at doing so.  I was, however, touched in the moment.  But that moment did not mean nearly as much to me then (and it meant a lot) as it does now.  When I think about it now I get overwhelmed imagining the number of emotions and memories and hopes my father simultaneously experienced at a level that it made a man, whom I have only ever seen cry twice, tear up to say goodbye to his oldest son.  \n Father’s day is a day to celebrate legendary men of honour, strength, and love from the generation before ours.  But it is also to support and encourage and edify the current generation of fathers many of whom are self-taught fathers living day to day just trying to get it right everyday.  I thank each and every one of those men for their example to me.  My children will be better people as I look to the example of my father and other honourable men who have worked hard and never given up on us their children. \n On this Father’s Day I would like to say to my father thank you for making me possible.  Thank you for accepting the divine call of a father becuase through all of the victories and failures, mistakes and successes as a father the person I am today was made possible and for better or for worse I am so grateful for that. \n Will you please share your memories, stories, and thanks with me and the readers of my blog this Father’s Day weekend.  Thank you. \n Posted in Family\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: Family, fathers, gratitude, Hope, Love\t\t\t\t\t \n So a good friend of mine who is living in the frosty paradise of Minnesota is working on a class assignment where they have to conceive and plan a restaurant.  She enticed me to here wall thread by sending me a message to read her restaurant post.  Of course, being a chef, I’m a sucker for a restaurant wall post so I bit.  That’s when I saw it was an assignment.  I read all of the comments and my magical soap box drop like a brick out of my nether-regions.  So before I could hijack her peaceful thread I took some deep breaths and told her I would post my thoughts here so that they would be accessible to her co-threaders and so I could be my usual long winded self and not feel bad about being this smelly dark pompous cigar cloud on her wall.  \n Don’t get me wrong.  I think that all of her friends had great comments and insights that I’m sure will be great for her assignment.  But when you ask for my opinion about restaurant concepts and design you’re asking for a very large piece of baggage to be unpacked and dumped forth. \n The overall responses were in the vein of cuisine themes or gimick themes.  \n Gimick themes (ie the dutch oven restaurant with covered wagons, or the mexican place with the cliff divers (Casa Bonita I think), etc)  most definitely have their place on the culinary landscape and they make great business sense because most are family friendly.  But being a chef I have a bit of an arrogant food snob side and I am not a fan of 99% of those restaurants.  Although if and when I get my own restaurant group running (see about the kitchen) I will definitely have one or two chain restaurant veterans on my staff because those people know how to make money in the food biz. \n Cuisine Themes.  One of her friends who talked about cuisines asked a question about why ethnic cuisines are generally poor quality in this country.  (Hold on let me see if I can find that soap box in my carpet bag…oh here it is) Okay I can get rather heated about this subject because here is the problem.  I am american so when I make Chinese food it will be American-Chinese food.  The only exception to this is a chef who has spent YEARS in the country of origin of that cuisine doing nothing but studying and practicing and absorbing the food and the culture.  Like Rick Bayless at Topolabampo in Chicago.   A cuisine is more than it’s spices and it’s varied foodstuffs it’s also it’s culture and it’s traditions.  If I want to cook authentic and delicious Indian food in America I need to move to India “become Indian” and then come back.  (P.S. this theory is slightly flawed because it is acually never going to make my food 100% authentic because I can not help but bring my own experience, culture, tradition, and palate to the stove and that is just as much an ingredient as coriander or saffron).  Even when natives come here and open a restaurant you sometimes find that their time here has changed there experience and has added something American to their food.  Plus sometimes the type, quality, etc of a key ingredient might be different here than in an origin country. \n So after all that here are some ideas for a restaurant(s) that I think my friend should look into. \n First of all Minnesota has some wonderful native ingredients including wild game and whole grains.  There is a great company out of St. Paul I think called Indian Harvest (www.indianharvest.com) that has some amazing grains.  I’ve introduced several to BYU this year.  Obviously with the posts on this blog I’m becoming an avid supporter of seasonal/local/sustainable/organic more so in restaurants even than at home.  (I’ll post more about that next week) \n Some restaurant models I like include the One World Everybody Eats Community Kitchen model out of SLC.  No Menu, No prices.  Everyone pays what they can when they can and the owners are making a statement and a profit.  I also like the Kogi Korean BBQ truck out of L.A.  I’d love to see that in a restaurant setting though I worry that it will dull the excitement because chasing the dragon seems to be a big part of the experience (extraordinary atmosphere is not just about a dining room).  Taco  \n My previous (twenty minute) restaurant experience had  a great mix of culinary ideas on it.  There was some Asian influence and some Mexican influence and a whole lot of American influence.  America has an amazing culinary heritage if you go looking for it. \n Anyway I hope, my friend, this helps.  If you want I can post some menu ideas on your wall to help further inspire you if you want.  Let me know. \n Okay this post is too long I’m going to end here.  Before I go though everyone check out a new link on my sidebar.  (bestamericanretreats.com) Okay, yeah I’m a little biased because I know the owners but these guys know their stuff. \n Posted in Uncategorized\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n In a comment to the post “Jesus is a Locavore” Kory made some great observations regarding the global consequences of worldwide locavorism.  Obviously he and I are not holding hands over this issue but I do think a lot of what he says is true.  But I think there is more that we can do and there is more that our ancestors did do centuries before locavore was even a word. \n While conventional agriculture degrades the environment and is not likely to work well in the long term; it is still much more profitable than organic agriculture.  That means that as long as we can make it bigger, cheaper, faster and as long as the economics of it continue to make good bottom line sense the free capitalist market will demand that it continues.  In the long run there will always be people who choose the easy option over the more environmentally friendly one.  Plus, with increased need for large amounts of food due to the expanding world population; we will soon run out of room to grow enough crops to feed everyone if we only use organic methods.  \n I was once taught by a church leader that as stewards of the faith and stewards of this earth it is our duty to teach the ideal.  We must teach “the letter of the law” and not “the spirit of the law” even though most will choose to live the latter.  So I have chosen to put forth this idea that the revealed standards of health in section 89 of the Doctrine and Covenants are best kept with a green and local lifestyle because more and more people are becoming concerned not only with the health of their families, but also with the health of the environment.  \n  Organic agriculture may become more prevalent as we become more aware of the negative environmental and physical effects of pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, hormones, and other chemicals.  It is believed by some, on the worldwide front, that families who use organic agricultural in developing countries may make more money than traditional farmers in the same areas and have a higher standard of living. \n Since neither type of agriculture seems to be going anywhere, it’s likely the two will have to coexist in the future.  The ideal situation would be that both methods were used in conjunction with each other depending on the environmental, financial, and political situation.  This way, people can have the benefit of increased yields from traditional agriculture along with the health and environmental benefits of organic agriculture.  The problem with this theory is that the two sides are unlikely to reach a compromise and work together any time soon.  These two different mind sets will probably be at odds until it is absolutely necessary to make changes.  \n  While organic agriculture may not be able to take over the world and solve all the environmental and dietary problems we face; it still has the ability to make an significant impact.  \n Posted in Food, Locavore, Organic Food, Organic Living\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Food, Green, localvore, Locavore, organic, sustainable agriculture, Word of Wisdom\t\t\t\t\t \n In her book Between Two Fires: Intimate Writings on Life, Love, Food, and Flavor Laura Esquivel talks about the sanctity of the hearth and the lessons that can be shared with the next generation there. This is a sentiment that resonates with me. I feel as if I could be used to share something with others while standing at the hearth. \n I have, yet again, become acutely aware of the Lord’s hand in my life not only at the hearth but away from it as well.    Often as I look back on my journey I see His hand at work.  I see many people He has brought into my life to challenge my doubts and my beliefs, questioned my choices, and bless me with opportunities to learn and grow. \n At times I find myself somewhat estranged from my Father.  I drift away from the prayer life or I become greatly disillusioned about something that He has put in front of me or allowed me to stumble over.  But I am always aware of His presence and His guidance.  \n Sometime after church services yesterday had completed my three-year old son got lost.  But the greatness of our God was never absent from me.  The Spirit told me that everything was fine and after searching the path home from church the Spirit told me to go back to the church, that he was still there and had never left.  Sure enough not thirty seconds after reentering the building there he was. \n This is not an isolated incident for me and though it doesn’t happen as often as I imagine it does for many of my spiritual role models, like Louis Giglio, Louis Palo, or Thomas S. Monson. It does happen, He does show me the goodness of His grace time and time again. \n  I must admit, however, that as I go through these “connected” days and as I meditate on His hand in my life I find myself slipping into fear.  Is it possible that He can have plans to use such a seemingly useless tool as an average-quality chef to bless the lives of others?  One thing that I know about this Divine Mentor of mine is that He likes to see me out of my comfort zone and there are times when I see a picture or hear a story about something that I would be uncomfortable doing and gently He whispers in my mind, “this too will come to you.”  So yes, maybe He does intend to use such a lowly tool as this or maybe He is just guiding me to a place where He will use someone greater than I to change and inspire me.  It would not be there first time. \n Posted in devotional, Faith\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: chef, Divine Mentor, grace, Holy Spirit, Hope, humilty, Jesus\t\t\t\t\t \n This past week or two I have experienced some sort of circular kismet or revelation…something that I can already see changing my life forever (again).  In 1992 I cold turkey began eating a ovo-lacto vegetarian diet (meatless diet that includes eggs and dairy).  By 1994 I had pretty much stopped drinking alcohol (not that I was ever much of a drinker) and I was never a fan of tea or coffee.  However, in 1998 as I prepared to enter the former culinary arts program at Utah State University I reintroduced meat to my diet.  In 1999 I was baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. \n Once again I have begun to seriously consider my dietary lifestyle and as I have struggled to make what are going to be radical changes (and changes that are proving more difficult to make than they were in 1992) I have found myself preparing a Sunday school lesson on the Word of Wisdom, a dietary and health code for members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that is not unlike Kosher restrictions for Jewish adherents or Islamic halal standards.  This code is housed within the pages of the Doctrine and Covenants (D\u0026C) a book of scripture within the Latter-day Saint cannon. \n The verse that tripped the light switch was D\u0026C 89:11 \n Every herb in the season thereof, and every fruit in the season thereof; all these to be used with prudence and thanksgiving. \n You do not have to be a culinary professional like myself to know that “seasonal” is one of the pillars of the local and sustainable food movements.  For me, professionally,  the sustainable and local food movements have proven more a thorn and a nuisance than anything.  In my market the majority of consumers don’t understand why I don’t want to sell asparagus in January or why their honeydew and watermelon taste bland in December.   \n Also a problem is that I would love to be able to cook professionally in a manner that is in keeping with how I should and would like to be eating personally.  But the vegetarian, organic, sustainable, etc food market is not quite as lucrative in my neck of the woods (Central Utah) as in other parts of the country.  Or at least not from the employee view point.  The presence of national health food chains like Whole Foods and Sunflower and local markets like Good Earth show that there is a movement here it just seems less tapped into in comparison to nearby California, Oregon, or Washington. \n And so the saga continues I am changing my lifestyle and it seems that I have divine support in the matter.  I guess it is time to, in the words of a fellow church member, “…ask in the name of Jesus Christ for the self-discipline to change [my] lifelong and vanity cherished habits.” \n Posted in Faith, Locavore\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: chef, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, diet, Food, Green, Jesus, localvore, Locavore, organic, sustainable agriculture, vegetarian, Word of Wisdom\t\t\t\t\t \n I’m definitely starting to feel Kermit the frog’s life long pain.  It ain’t easy being green.  The more I concern myself with greening my life the more frustrated I become.  There is a reason that statistically so few Americans have made “major” changes in their homes to green their lifestyles. \n Today in Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco the film “Food, Inc.” will open with more openings in the coming weeks nation wide.  That will show some of the reasons for these slow changes.   But let’s face facts one of the biggest reason is money.  Fat is cheap and in today’s economy cheap is good.  Isn’t it? \n I have a hard time paying more for organic produce, Whole grain breads, and free range chicken when my monthly paycheck is barely covering the bills every month.  Proponents of green living are always talking about how much less expensive it is to buy organic because it doesn’t travel as far and it isn’t laced with harmful chemicals, therefore, cutting down on fuel costs and health care expenditures.  But guess what?  It costs me the same amount in fuel to drive to my local grocery store to buy non-organic as it does to buy organic and the non-organic removes less money from my bank account.  Also even though I have insurance through my job I can’t afford health care.  Despite the myth that having insurance makes it possible for more people to get health care if your paycheck isn’t making it to the end of the month paying for food, clothing, and shelter that extra $20 co-pay or $40 prescription is not affordable. \n Who knows in the word’s of Kermit maybe someday “When green is all there is to be/It could make you wonder why, but why wonder why/Wonder, I am green and it’ll do fine, it’s beautiful/And I think it’s what I want to be”  but right now I’m trying to eat healthier on the same money or less and organic doesn’t always fit the budget. \n Posted in Food\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: Food, Green, organic, sustainable agriculture\t\t\t\t\t \n Blog at WordPress.com.

  "inline_text": "Fyrkuna Metalworks \n Liberia \n Fyrkuna metalworks is a Liberian-owned company with a german manager, Manfred Zbrzezny. Working since 2007 we specialize in weapon conversion, “Arms into art ” Furthermore we execute metal construction and design works in steel.Broom Camp, Brewerville, Montserrado County, Liberia \n On major projects, we employed up to 12 welders, but since one of the difficulties encountered was the lack of technical skill in local welders we redimensioned our set up. Our hope is to conduct proper and serious training for our workers and future apprentices. \n To maintain our capacity in professional welding we are able to contract certified African welders. \n Training workshops for the producers of improved cooking stoves ( red firepot)  have been conducted at our facility. \n  \n I work since 2007 on the weapon conversion project – arms into art. The weapon scrap is a left-over from the disarmament process. \n The first request was if I could create a banister with a marine design for a restaurant on the Saint Paul river, home to the local fishing club . Having completed this I designed furniture for the same place made from Rpg-launchers, AK 47 barrels, and wood. \n My next job was to create small objects such as candle stands, bookends, school bells, and bottle openers. \n In 2008 on request by Save the children- U.k. I developed a small tree for their fundraiser “Festival of Trees”, which was auctioned for 24.000 Pound Sterling entirely for the benefit of Liberian children. Children from 2 communities in Monrovia collaborated on this project with drawings and words on the importance of peace. These small messages on paper were placed into shell casings hanging on the tree as its fruits.The company that purchased it decided to sponsor a bigger tree for the people of Liberia. This peace tree is in place on Providence Island since 2011. \n I produce these objects together with the welders and trainees of Fyrkuna-metalworks.In the design, I try to create a contra point to the mean implications of weapons by shapes of nature and serenity. \n To transform arms into art illustrates the complex process in which a destructive device, which has been demobilized, becomes a creative part of the metal design.Working on weapon scrap in Liberia has its implications. For example, the peace tree is intended to be a reminder ” not to forget “ and to express our hope for a peaceful life in Liberia. It carries a message for the Liberian people, they can transform their past suffering into something positive. A prolonged civil war leaves wounds in both society and individuals and reconstruction is not only a material process but also somehow spiritual. \n A way of helping in this healing process is transforming arms into art. Furthermore it is a clear political statement. \n Looking at arms into art the majority of people remains thoughtfully silent, some feel uncomfortable and a few enthusiastic. A marine while observing a sculpture remarked ” You are making a long nose to all soldiers.” \n During the working process, the blacksmith can have his flight of thoughts related to what he is producing. On weapon, scrap is naturally the thought of what became of the perpetrators and the victims. This moment often leads me to leave the work for a while, but getting used to the material brought me to see it just as scrap. But the thought still occurs ” what became of…” .Someone is expressing himself by singing, someone is expressing himself by shooting.It is the duty of those that sing to stop the others from shooting.. \n Fyrkuna Metal Works – Liberia \n Fyrkuna Metal Works – Liberia \n  \n Fyrkuna Metalworks specializes in Weapon conversion “arms into art“.

Our hope is to conduct proper and serious training for our workers and future apprentices.\n\n\n\nTo maintain our capacity in professional welding we are able to contract certified African welders.\n\n\n\nTraining workshops for the producers of improved cooking stoves ( red firepot)  have been conducted at our facility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts\n\n\n\nBlacksmithingMetal carpentryHeavy-duty weldingTrainingWeapon conversion “arms into art“Artistic designImproved cooking stoves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorksforce\n\n\n\nOne manager and artistic blacksmith/ designerOne blacksmithTwo  welderTwo apprentice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorks executed\n\n\n\nTree made of weapon scrap at the Peace Hut, Todi commissioned by UN Women.Tables, benches, and banister made from weapon scrap at Marlin Corner.Two trees from weapon scrap for Save the Children U.K.Entrance grill door, banister, window bars, underground and day fuel tank at LBDI-branch 9th street.Banister, grill doors, window bars, steel doors, and supports at National Election Commission 10th street Sinkor.Gates and fence at Insurance Company of Africa, Sinkor.Window bars, steel doors, and supports for solar panels for GTZ Police Promotion Project, Lofa County.Massive cash boxes for Care International microloan project.We are a certified producer for the red fire pot, an improved cooking stove for Liberian use. This is part of a project by Giz-Endev.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArms Into Art Liberian Style\n\n\n\nPeace Tree, UN Women.\n\n\n\nI work since 2007 on the weapon conversion project – arms into art. The weapon scrap is a left-over from the disarmament process.\n\n\n\nThe first request was if I could create a banister with a marine design for a restaurant on the Saint Paul river, home to the local fishing club . Having completed this I designed furniture for the same place made from Rpg-launchers, AK 47 barrels, and wood.\n\n\n\nMy next job was to create small objects such as candle stands, bookends, school bells, and bottle openers.\n\n\n\nIn 2008 on request by Save the children- U.k. I developed a small tree for their fundraiser “Festival of Trees”, which was auctioned for 24.000 Pound Sterling entirely for the benefit of Liberian children. Children from 2 communities in Monrovia collaborated on this project with drawings and words on the importance of peace. These small messages on paper were placed into shell casings hanging on the tree as its fruits.The company that purchased it decided to sponsor a bigger tree for the people of Liberia. This peace tree is in place on Providence Island since 2011.\n\n\n\nI produce these objects together with the welders and trainees of Fyrkuna-metalworks.In the design, I try to create a contra point to the mean implications of weapons by shapes of nature and serenity.\n\n\n\nTo transform arms into art illustrates the complex process in which a destructive device, which has been demobilized, becomes a creative part of the metal design.Working on weapon scrap in Liberia has its implications. For example, the peace tree is intended to be a reminder ” not to forget “ and to express our hope for a peaceful life in Liberia. It carries a message for the Liberian people, they can transform their past suffering into something positive. A prolonged civil war leaves wounds in both society and individuals and reconstruction is not only a material process but also somehow spiritual.\n\n\n\nA way of helping in this healing process is transforming arms into art. Furthermore it is a clear political statement.\n\n\n\nLooking at arms into art the majority of people remains thoughtfully silent, some feel uncomfortable and a few enthusiastic. A marine while observing a sculpture remarked ” You are making a long nose to all soldiers.”\n\n\n\nDuring the working process, the blacksmith can have his flight of thoughts related to what he is producing. On weapon, scrap is naturally the thought of what became of the perpetrators and the victims. This moment often leads me to leave the work for a while, but getting used to the material brought me to see it just as scrap. But the thought still occurs ” what became of…” .Someone is expressing himself by singing, someone is expressing himself by shooting.It is the duty of those that sing to stop the others from shooting..\n\n\n\nContact\n\n\n\n+231 8869 63969‬+231 7758 98890fyrkuna@yahoo.comFacebookInstagramFlickr Image GalleryTo Learn More Search Manfred Zbrzezny or Fyrkuna Metalworks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n",

  "inline_text": "Strangely enough, the two words are not meant to be interchangeable.  True, sometimes sex can be fun…and sometimes it can be bloody horrible too.  But my real point is, that the word fun should not be directly correlated to sex. \n Now, any woman that has ventured into the world of online dating has encountered those men (they appear to be legion) who mean nothing but sex, when they type the word fun on their keyboard (there may be women who think the same way – thankfully I personally have been spared their acquaintance thus far). \n It is not always easy to pick out those who subscribe to this narrow definition.  Sometimes, they put it in their profiles, or in an initial email, which gives the recipient the painless option of immediately blocking the profile, and/or deleting the email.  Quite simple really. \n But then there are those who write quite innocuous profiles (sometimes quite interesting ones), and who write pleasant and polite initial emails.  You respond, exchange a few more emails, begin to think “hey, this sounds like an interesting person”. and you move into IM exchanges. \n Now many websites have their own IMs, which make it easy to eliminate someone who transgresses (without having to block them from your personal online communication tool of choice.  Most sites do not have web-cam options though.  So the first clue, is when a man (or woman) becomes very urgent in their desire to talk to you on Messenger, Yahoo, Skype, etc.   A red flag that, curiously enough, they share with scammers. \n Once they exchange ids with you, and open up a chat window in this new platform, the next question is “Can you turn on your web-cam?”.    If you – wisely – demur to comply, the chances are, after some token protest, that they will accept your choice, but still insist on opening up their web-cam. \n Now, some of them will initially appear clothed.  Or at least, the portion of them that you can see is clothed.  If they are bare-chested, unless they appear to be sitting on a beach, where the passerbys are all wearing beach-style clothing, it is best to assume the nudity is total. \n It doesn’t take them long to get down to business (strange how I always considered business and fun to be at different ends of the spectrum!), and they will either invite you to view them (au naturale), ask you if you want to play a little, or if you want to watch them play a little.  If you again demur, they will then trot out the magic phrase “Aw, it’s just having a bit of fun!”. \n Seriously?  Watching some guy you barely/don’t  know jerk off, is fun?  Since when? \n Some of them don’t even ask first, but instead suddenly redirect the direction of their webcam in the direction of their genitalia, where they are already “playing”.  Presumably, they think that under those circumstances, you will be so enthralled by the sight of their appendage, that you will become glued to the screen, and pant along with them.   \n EEEWWWW!!! \n To the men that engage in this behaviour, or even try to entice women to play along, I have to say…this is NOT fun.  What this is, is crass, crude, vulgar and quite often disgusting and totally abhorent.   While an existing couple, in a loving relationship may choose to use internet sex as a way to maintain their relationship if temporarily separated, when it is a virtual stranger, then it is no better than having a man come up to you in the street, and expose himself to you.   \n Yes, guys, you are that dirty old man, in a dirty raincoat, flashing himself to strangers, in order to satisfy a perverse craving.  There is nothing “fun” about what you are doing, at all.  Women are not thrilled or turned on, seeing your naked penis.  You think we’ve never seen one before?  You think we might actually be impressed?  We might laugh at you and your rabid self-delusion – which is about as much fun as we will get from this situation – but we are never, ever impressed. \n I want the men/boys/perverts who consider this behaviour “fun” to find a dictionary, and check on the definition of the word.  I then want them to think back to their childhood, to that point where someone must have explained to them, that when you do something that hurts/upsets/disgusts/repels another person, no matter how much enjoyment you may personally gain from engaging in these actions, what you are doing is not fun, and is not acceptable behaviour.  Guys, is that what really turns you on?  Disgusting and revolting another human being?  If so, then you need serious therapy. \n I want the word fun given back to people who actually know how to have fun.  I don’t want to have to cringe, every time I talk to a man online, and he asks me if I want to have fun – I want to genuinely believe he is talking about inviting me out on a fun date, or something equally innocuous.  I don’t want to dread being asked if I have a webcam…I want to know that when someone asks to talk on webcam it’s because they want to genuinely see me as a person (and possibly to check I’m not posting fake photos).  When a man asks me if I want to watch him play online, I want him to mean he is playing a musical instrument. \n Because, to me, none of these things are fun, or playing, or having a good time.  What they are, is a man who is virtually a stranger to me, engaging in seriously deviant behaviour, that would get him arrested if he did it in person.  Being separated by the internet does not give someone licence to be a sex offender. \n   \n We’ve all heard of friends with benefits.  There has even been a movie recently made on the topic, which, being a romantic comedy, romanticises the notion, and of course, implies that such a course is not doomed to disaster. \n The tv series, Boston Legal, also visited the subject with two of their longer-running characters.  Of course, the fact that the woman in question was a very assertive, strong woman, who controlled the connection (at one point, she had two such “friends” at the same time) and that the main friend was in love with her made the whole scenario rather untrue to life. \n I know people who have walked that path.  In most cases it has led to disaster.  Way too many women think that if they go along with it, eventually the man in question will be smitten by their charms and will lay his heart at their feet.  In a couple of cases, it has worked out ok, but only when both people seriously do not want any more than a purely sexual arrangement, and both have eventually gone their separate ways quite happily.  But I personally, don’t know anyone that started off with that arrangement, and ended up together happily ever after.  No doubt it has happened, somewhere, to someone…but I would be very surprised if anyone could prove it to be a statistical probability. \n So, what is friends with benefits?  It is theoretically, an arrangement where two single people agree to meet sexual needs with each other, without all the hassle of a commitment of any kind (including something as harmless as boyfriend/girlfriend).  In essence, there are no promises, no guarantees, and either party is free to walk at any time guilt-free.  It sounds very mature, practical and modern, doesn’t it? \n Personally, since it is called friends with benefits, my literal assumption would be that the two people concerned were aquaintances, with common bonds and ties of friendship, and some background of liking and respect for one another.  Under those circumstances, and with suitable levels of sexual attraction for one another, and a background of social interaction which might or might not lead to sex on any given occasion, I could almost see this as being an eminently practical solution for many singles. \n There is a problem though. \n Many, many people who announce they want friends with benefits publicly – i.e. dating sites – are men…mostly very young men.  But for those who actually spell it out, they are not looking for any kind of friendship, or bond or social interaction with the opposite gender.  They just want to have sex without any kind of connection at all.  Most of them don’t even want to go through the parade of some kind of dating situation first.  Essentially, they want to name a time, a place, have the woman show up, satisfy the man’s needs, and then she disappears.  Purely mechanical, without any socialisation aspect to it at all.  Another, less flattering, but undoubtedly more honest name for this arrangement is a booty call.  Of course, to put it in it’s plainest, most unflattering terms, what these men want is a prostitute…but they don’t want to pay for one.  They want sex without intimacy, without developing any kind of liking or interest in the other person beforehand.  It’s the sexual equivalent of fast food. \n Of course, some women are happy with this arrangement.  I haven’t personally met one yet, but I am sure they are out there.  Mind you, I am sure the real working girls must eye with disbelief, those who exchange sex for…..nothing.  I don’t know if they have a motto, but if they do, I am sure it is something like “If you’re going to get laid, then you might as well get paid!”. \n This is the point at which someone is going to accuse me of being overly moral, or prudish…or possibly immoral after making up that slogan. \n But seriously…isn’t it really kind of sad and pathetic when two human beings couple in a mechanical, animalistic way…without having any genuine liking or interest in the other person?  And if you are happy to walk away without a background glance afterwards,then don’t try and argue that there is genuine liking or interest.  All you really mean is the other person didn’t revolt you. \n Humans are naturally social animals.  There is the odd exception, but most hermits become that way after being revolted or horrified or disgusted by the other humans they interact with.  An emotionally healthy human being, with healthy contacts with other human beings does not become a hermit.  Some people don’t need a lot of interactions, as long as those they do have are of high quality.  But we all need some. \n Sexual pairings are one way to add to our level of social interaction.  Certainly the whole courtship dance, whether or not it is designed or destined to end in a permanent pairing, is quite an exciting social interaction.  The initial attraction, flirting, the build-up of sexual tension, the anticipation…all of these things add  value to our lives.   When we skip all of that, and cut straight to the mechanical aspect of sex, then we lose all that excitement…the whole adrenaline rush of courtship. \n This leads me to suspect that those who seek only a no-strings attached coupling (NSA sex) are unable to achieve intimacy.  I exempt those who are in a temporary state of damage; e.g. the person who is recently out of a bad relationship, for example.  But for someone who doesn’t have that excuse….someone who simply want to “f*ck and flee” on every occasion…there is something definitely wrong with them, because a healthy social animal doesn’t work that way. \n As I said, there seems to be a preponderance of them on online dating sites.  I suspect that what seems to be an excessive number may be in part due to them flooding any and all prospects with their enticing emails..”U r hott…want 2 hav sum fun?”.  But there are certainly far more of them then there should be. \n So, friends without benefits is, to my mind at least, a bad idea.  So, I would like to suggest an alternative…sex with benefits. \n It works this way..two people meet who are sexually attracted to one another.  Rather than running at one another like animals in rut, and then running away again after before there can possibly be any suggestion of any other kind of interaction, they take a whole new approach.  They both actually work at heightening the attraction.  They flirt, they do things like dancing (incredibly sexual activity), they learn how to seduce the other person’s mind (yes, seduction is actually very sexual…who’d have thought?), they create an environment where brushing the other person’s hand is enough to trigger that rush of excitement and thrills.  And then when the tension is at it’s height, then and only then take the steps to actually engage in the next level of intimacy…and do that in the expectation that sexual intimacy also takes time (more than one night please!) to build and heighten into something bigger and better. \n Ok, maybe this won’t result in a white wedding, house in the suburbs, and 2.4 kids.  I never said they would, and in fact those results actually have very little to do with emotional intimacy…in many cases, those things can directly destroy or more frequently lead to atrophy of that intimacy.  But maybe, if more people learnt how to focus on building that intimacy in the first place, then relationships would be better overall, and have a higher success rate. \n And if, to get back to my food metaphor, people ate a lot less fast food, and learnt how to cook their own gourmet meals in partnership with others…they have a far better chance of eating in style for life.  And if one cooking partnership falls apart after a while, then you are better situated to find a new cooking partner in future.  Less running from one fast food joint to another, and more long-term exploration and development of fine restaurants (if you are still hanging in with this metaphor, good for you!). \n Anyway I, and I am sure a lot of other people out there don’t want an endless chain of soulless sexual encounters.  We want sex…but with all the benefits that it can bring…social interaction, emotional satisfaction, and sometimes even, an actual relationship.  Because frankly, if we are going to treat sex like a business transaction…then we might as well be getting paid for it. \n I joined a new gym today.  For most of the twelve months, since relocating to attend university, I have worked out at home.  Functional, but not always that exciting.  I did try out the university gym for a couple of months, but since there was a definite his area/her area vibe going on (weight area/cardio area respectively), and since in any case there was only one set of hand weights under 10kg apiece, it didn’t maintain my attention for long. \n So…it’s been over twelve months since I have consistently worked out in a gym.  I picked this one for a couple of reasons.  Location first up – it’s located on the path between uni and home, so very hard to avoid.  Secondly, the hours.  It’s a 24 hour gym, which works right in with my study induced insomnia.  Thirdly, it’s brand-new.  This has multiple benefits.  One is that they were offering very tempting joining offers.  Two is that there will not be a core of long-term residents who consider they “own” the place.  Three is…chock full of brand new, state of the art equipment. \n By and large, I prefer free weights, primarily because you engage more muscles when using them.  Of course, machines that isolate muscles do have an important role to play, particularly for people with injuries, who wish to consider training without causing further damage to a specific area.  And of course, when you train regularly, using machines can help to break up routines, and eliminate monotony. \n So, I am intrigued by the range of new designs this gym holds.   Since I don’t work out of a gym, I haven’t really kept up with the latest and greatest designs in machines, and obviously, I am going to be broadening my knowledge base in that regard. \n So, the next few weeks are going to be  interesting, as I find my way about this place, and more importantly, work out a whole new routine…and hopefully find some interesting things to write about. \n First sports medicine class on taping techniques yesterday.  After a session on how to do it right, we were all armed with tape, and directed to team up with someone else.  Being lucky that way, I ended up with two somebody else’s, and since I had already been nominated to be the first victim…er, patient…this meant I had both ankles being taped at the same time.  Just as well I wore running pants to the class. \n The moment of entertainment for me, was when the assistant tutor came to check my two classmates’ technique.  She is twenty something, and currently on crutches as a result of ankle surgery.  Blithely she asks me what ankle injuries I have sustained in my life.  Just as blithely, I answered none.  She looked at me…hard.  “Never?” she asks? “Nope” I replied.  All around me are my fellow students, many of them considerably younger than me.  Having not much to do while my ankles were strapped up, I had been eavesdropping on conversations all around me.  The class was riddled with all these healthy young things, whose ankle joints appear to be on the point of needing replacement.  And here am I, well, not ancient, but not twenty-something either, freely jumping up and down to prove just how great my ankles are.  It was a happy moment. \n Just as well she didn’t ask me about my knees… \n Well, this is my first post in a while.  Blame it on life.  Prep classes before the uni semester started again, and of course, getting into the swing of the new semester.  Not to mention starting a new part-time job, and of course, getting the munchkin organised into various sporting activities.  It’s been hectic. \n However, I finally found myself with time today to take a breath, and actually logged in here to see what’s been happening (aka, has anyone continued to visit my blog while it’s been static?).  Which, I am happy to say has been happening, and has cheered me immensely, and given me the boot in the pants to get started again. \n My courses this semester include functional anatomy, and sports medicine, so I am sure they are going to jumpstart me in many new directions.  In addition, I continue to pursue the cause of clean and healthy food. \n So here’s crossing my fingers that I get the ball rolling smoothly again.  And start writing something of substance.  😀 \n Enter

situation – but we are never, ever impressed.\nI want the men/boys/perverts who consider this behaviour “fun” to find a dictionary, and check on the definition of the word.  I then want them to think back to their childhood, to that point where someone must have explained to them, that when you do something that hurts/upsets/disgusts/repels another person, no matter how much enjoyment you may personally gain from engaging in these actions, what you are doing is not fun, and is not acceptable behaviour.  Guys, is that what really turns you on?  Disgusting and revolting another human being?  If so, then you need serious therapy.\nI want the word fun given back to people who actually know how to have fun.  I don’t want to have to cringe, every time I talk to a man online, and he asks me if I want to have fun – I want to genuinely believe he is talking about inviting me out on a fun date, or something equally innocuous.  I don’t want to dread being asked if I have a webcam…I want to know that when someone asks to talk on webcam it’s because they want to genuinely see me as a person (and possibly to check I’m not posting fake photos).  When a man asks me if I want to watch him play online, I want him to mean he is playing a musical instrument.\nBecause, to me, none of these things are fun, or playing, or having a good time.  What they are, is a man who is virtually a stranger to me, engaging in seriously deviant behaviour, that would get him arrested if he did it in person.  Being separated by the internet does not give someone licence to be a sex offender.\n \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t__ATA.cmd.push(function() {\n\t\t\t\t\t__ATA.initDynamicSlot({\n\t\t\t\t\t\tid: 'atatags-26942-60a78fd2ecd97',\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlocation:

of friends with benefits.  There has even been a movie recently made on the topic, which, being a romantic comedy, romanticises the notion, and of course, implies that such a course is not doomed to disaster.\nThe tv series, Boston Legal, also visited the subject with two of their longer-running characters.  Of course, the fact that the woman in question was a very assertive, strong woman, who controlled the connection (at one point, she had two such “friends” at the same time) and that the main friend was in love with her made the whole scenario rather untrue to life.\nI know people who have walked that path.  In most cases it has led to disaster.  Way too many women think that if they go along with it, eventually the man in question will be smitten by their charms and will lay his heart at their feet.  In a couple of cases, it has worked out ok, but only when both people seriously do not want any more than a purely sexual arrangement, and both have eventually gone their separate ways quite happily.  But I personally, don’t know anyone that started off with that arrangement, and ended up together happily ever after.  No doubt it has happened, somewhere, to someone…but I would be very surprised if anyone could prove it to be a statistical probability.\nSo, what is friends with benefits?  It is theoretically, an arrangement where two single people agree to meet sexual needs with each other, without all the hassle of a commitment of any kind (including something as harmless as boyfriend/girlfriend).  In essence, there are no promises, no guarantees, and either party is free to walk at any time guilt-free.  It sounds very mature, practical and modern, doesn’t it?\nPersonally, since it is called friends with benefits, my literal assumption would be that the two people concerned were aquaintances, with common bonds and ties of friendship, and some background of liking and respect for one another.  Under those circumstances, and with suitable levels of sexual attraction for one another, and a background of social interaction which might or might not lead to sex on any given occasion, I could almost see this as being an eminently practical solution for many singles.\nThere is a problem though.\nMany, many people who announce they want friends with benefits publicly – i.e. dating sites – are men…mostly very young men.  But for those who actually spell it out, they are not looking for any kind of friendship, or bond or social interaction with the opposite gender.  They just want to have sex without any kind of connection at all.  Most of them don’t even want to go through the parade of some kind of dating situation first.  Essentially, they want to name a time, a place, have the woman show up, satisfy the man’s needs, and then she disappears.  Purely mechanical, without any socialisation aspect to it at all.  Another, less flattering, but undoubtedly more honest name for this arrangement is a booty call.  Of course, to put it in it’s plainest, most unflattering terms, what these men want is a prostitute…but they don’t want to pay for one.  They want sex without intimacy, without developing any kind of liking or interest in the other person beforehand.  It’s the sexual equivalent of fast food.\nOf course, some women are happy with this arrangement.  I haven’t personally met one yet, but I am sure they are out there.  Mind you, I am sure the real working girls must eye with disbelief, those who exchange sex for…..nothing.  I don’t know if they have a motto, but if they do, I am sure it is something like “If you’re going to get laid, then you might as well get paid!”.\nThis is the point at which someone is going to accuse me of being overly moral, or prudish…or possibly immoral after making up that slogan.\nBut seriously…isn’t it really kind of sad and pathetic when two human beings couple in a mechanical, animalistic way…without having any genuine liking or interest in the other person?  And if you are happy to walk away without a background glance afterwards,then don’t try and argue that there is genuine liking or interest.  All you really mean is the other person didn’t revolt you.\nHumans are naturally social animals.  There is the odd exception, but most hermits become that way after being revolted or horrified or disgusted by the other humans they interact with.  An emotionally healthy human being, with healthy contacts with other human beings does not become a hermit.  Some people don’t need a lot of interactions, as long as those they do have are of high quality.  But we all need some.\nSexual pairings are one way to add to our level of social interaction.  Certainly the whole courtship dance, whether or not it is designed or destined to end in a permanent pairing, is quite an exciting social interaction.  The initial attraction, flirting, the build-up of sexual tension, the anticipation…all of these things add  value to our lives.   When we skip all of that, and cut straight to the mechanical aspect of sex, then we lose all that excitement…the whole adrenaline rush of courtship.\nThis leads me to suspect that those who seek only a no-strings attached coupling (NSA sex) are unable to achieve intimacy.  I exempt those who are in a temporary state of damage; e.g. the person who is recently out of a bad relationship, for example.  But for someone who doesn’t have that excuse….someone who simply want to “f*ck and flee” on every occasion…there is something definitely wrong with them, because a healthy social animal doesn’t work that way.\nAs I said, there seems to be a preponderance of them on online dating sites.  I suspect that what seems to be an excessive number may be in part due to them flooding any and all prospects with their enticing emails..”U r hott…want 2 hav sum fun?”.  But there are certainly far more of them then there should be.\nSo, friends without benefits is, to my mind at least, a bad idea.  So, I would like to suggest an alternative…sex with benefits.\nIt works this way..two people meet who are sexually attracted to one another.  Rather than running at one another like animals in rut, and then running away again after before there can possibly be any suggestion of any other kind of interaction, they take a whole new approach.  They both actually work at heightening the attraction.  They flirt, they do things like dancing (incredibly sexual activity), they learn how to seduce the other person’s mind (yes, seduction is actually very sexual…who’d have thought?), they create an environment where brushing the other person’s hand is enough to trigger that rush of excitement and thrills.  And then when the tension is at it’s height, then and only then take the steps to actually engage in the next level of intimacy…and do that in the expectation that sexual intimacy also takes time (more than one night please!) to build and heighten into something bigger and better.\nOk, maybe this won’t result in a white wedding, house in the suburbs, and 2.4 kids.  I never said they would, and in fact those results actually have very little to do with emotional intimacy…in many cases, those things can directly destroy or more frequently lead to atrophy of that intimacy.  But maybe, if more people learnt how to focus on building that intimacy in the first place, then relationships would be better overall, and have a higher success rate.\nAnd if, to get back to my food metaphor, people ate a lot less fast food, and learnt how to cook their own gourmet meals in partnership with others…they have a far better chance of eating in style for life.  And if one cooking partnership falls apart after a while, then you are better situated to find a new cooking partner in future.  Less running from one fast food joint to another, and more long-term exploration and development of fine restaurants (if you are still hanging in with this metaphor, good for you!).\nAnyway I, and I am sure a lot of other people out there don’t want an endless chain of soulless sexual encounters.  We want sex…but with all the benefits that it can bring…social interaction, emotional satisfaction, and sometimes even, an actual relationship.  Because frankly, if we are going to treat sex like a business transaction…then we might as well be getting paid for it.\n\n        \n            __ATA.cmd.push(function() {\n

\n \n\t\n\t\tBack to the coal face – a.k.a. gym\n\n\t\t\n\t\tPosted on March 12, 2011 by redfyre\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\tI joined a new gym today.  For most of the twelve months, since relocating to attend university, I have worked out at home.  Functional, but not always that exciting.  I did try out the university gym for a couple of months, but since there was a definite his area/her area vibe going on (weight area/cardio area respectively), and since in any case there was only one set of hand weights under 10kg apiece, it didn’t maintain my attention for long.\nSo…it’s been over twelve months since I have consistently worked out in a gym.  I picked this one for a couple of reasons.  Location first up – it’s located on the path between uni and home, so very hard to avoid.  Secondly, the hours.  It’s a 24 hour gym, which works right in with my study induced insomnia.  Thirdly, it’s brand-new.  This has multiple benefits.  One is that they were offering very tempting joining offers.  Two is that there will not be a core of long-term residents who consider they “own” the place.  Three is…chock full of brand new, state of the art equipment.\nBy and large, I prefer free weights, primarily because you engage more muscles when using them.  Of course, machines that isolate muscles do have an important role to play, particularly for people with injuries, who wish to consider training without causing further damage to a specific area.  And of course, when you train regularly, using machines can help to break up routines, and eliminate monotony.\nSo, I am intrigued by the range of new designs this gym holds.   Since I don’t work out of a gym, I haven’t really kept up with the latest and greatest designs in machines, and obviously, I am going to be broadening my knowledge base in that regard.\nSo, the next few weeks are going to be  interesting, as I find my way about this place, and more importantly, work out a whole new routine…and hopefully find some interesting things to write about.\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tPosted in Exercise \u0026 Fitness\t\t | \n\t\tTagged exercise, fitness, health, personal trainers, personal training, postaday2011 | \t\tLeave a

session on how to do it right, we were all armed with tape, and directed to team up with someone else.  Being lucky that way, I ended up with two somebody else’s, and since I had already been nominated to be the first victim…er, patient…this meant I had both ankles being taped at the same time.  Just as well I wore running pants to the class.\nThe moment of entertainment for me, was when the assistant tutor came to check my two classmates’ technique.  She is twenty something, and currently on crutches as a result of ankle surgery.  Blithely she asks me what ankle injuries I have sustained in my life.  Just as blithely, I answered none.  She looked at me…hard.  “Never?” she asks? “Nope” I replied.  All around me are my fellow students, many of them considerably younger than me.  Having not much to do while my ankles were strapped up, I had been eavesdropping on conversations all around me.  The class was riddled with all these healthy young things, whose ankle joints appear to be on the point of needing replacement.  And here am I, well, not ancient, but not twenty-something either, freely jumping up and down to prove just how great my ankles are.  It was a happy moment.\nJust as well she didn’t ask me about my knees…\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tPosted in Exercise \u0026 Fitness\t\t | \n\t\tTagged exercise, fitness, health, joint strapping, joint taping, lifestyle,

in a while.  Blame it on life.  Prep classes before the uni semester started again, and of course, getting into the swing of the new semester.  Not to mention starting a new part-time job, and of course, getting the munchkin organised into various sporting activities.  It’s been hectic.\nHowever, I finally found myself with time today to take a breath, and actually logged in here to see what’s been happening (aka, has anyone continued to visit my blog while it’s been static?).  Which, I am happy to say has been happening, and has cheered me immensely, and given me the boot in the pants to get started again.\nMy courses this semester include functional anatomy, and sports medicine, so I am sure they are going to jumpstart me in many new directions.  In addition, I continue to pursue the cause of clean and healthy food.\nSo here’s crossing my fingers that I get the ball rolling smoothly again.  And start writing something of substance.  😀\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tPosted in

Här hittar du information om privata fonder och stiftelser, statliga och regionala understöd, samt nordiska stödformer och EU-finansiering.  \n  \nPå startsidan är bidragskällorna listade kronologiskt enligt ansökningstid. Du kan göra en textsökning i sökfältet, eller klicka på länken “Filter” och söka fram bidragskällor med hjälp av sökord. Här kan du också välja att lista de bidragskällor som har fortlöpande eller varierande ansökningstider, de som annars är listade efter bidragskällorna med en ett exakt datum. I sökresultaten listas endast de bidragskällor som har en ansökningstid i framtiden definierad.  \n \nInformationen i fyrk.fi uppdateras kontinuerligt av personalen i Luckan.  Fr.o.m. senhösten 2013 ges alla bidragskällor möjligheten att själva uppdatera sin information i fyrk.fi.  \n  \n \n\nTipsa oss gärna om bidragskällor som inte syns i sökresultaten.  \n \n\nAnsökningstiderna i sökresultaten kan vara preliminära/riktgivande. Kontrollera ALLTID ansökningstiderna på bidragskällans hemsida.  \n \n\nFörfrågningar rörande Fyrk.fi görs till Karl Norrbom, e-post: [email protected]  \n \n\nDen första versionen av Fyrk.fi versionen lanserades av Luckan i Helsingfors år 2003, med finansiering från Svenska kulturfonden, som också stöder utformningen av den här nya versionen. Nya Fyrk.fi har också ingått i ett projekt som finansierades av Nylands Förbund. I projektet kartlade vi kommuners intresse i östra Nyland att använda Fyrk.fi som plattform för att informera om kommunala stipendier och understöd. \n \n Välkommen till ProjektProffs - ett stödverktyg för projektaktörer. Använd ProjektProffs när du vill utveckla ditt projektkunnande och öka din konkurrenskraft vid sökandet av externa projektmedel. \n \nInnehållet i ProjektProffs har skapats av PDGE Oy och Kreativa delaktiga Finland synliggör materialet på fyrk.fi i samarbete med Svenska kulturfonden.  \n  ",

  "inline_text": "\n\t\t\t\tThe feminine perspective\t\t\t \n And she stood above them on the ledge looking down\nDropping petals from marigolds and Pansies and a rose\nWatching them drift and twist slowly round\nWith fragile wings reaching for their destiny far below \n And when we got there she was already on the ground\nStaring up at us with a smile\nAs though she found the answer to her tears\nThere on her journey down \n The one that evaded her all those years\nAnd stood there still and leaning over the rail did I\nWaiting for a sign that all was well\nLong and hard and cold watching her lie \n And among those broken blossoms where she fell\nShe did not stir nor waver once nor even sigh\nLying among the flowers that i gave her\nwhen i said farewell \n Where there is fear there is hope, where there is darkness there is light, where there is suffering there is kindness, and where there is hate there is love. These are our weapons to counter oppression and bigotry. Be steadfast in your faith. America is great. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n   \n Some of us know too well the test of adversity and hardship and live in fear every day but still manage to put on a happy face and walk out the door. We have done it most of our lives. Having felt a little sunshine these past 8 years it is only natural to want more when storm clouds threaten to disrupt our picnic. However remember when the rain cometh this time things are different. If we have learned one thing in all of those early years of struggle, we are not alone. Women and men, straight and not so straight of every color, ethnicity and religion have banded together as Americans to build a new future. We have sanged and danced in the streets like children, laughed and even cried over tragedies that have honed our multifaceted  character into one unified people for justice and principles that we claim unilaterally are: American. We have faced civil unrest, the enslavement of a people, bombing of churches, wars to end all wars, the unfair internment of some of our friends and neighbors of oriental decent, Stonewall, McCarthyism, the atrocities of Viet Nam, Watergate scandals, infidelities from our trusted officials too numerous to mention, and the fall of the twin towers which led to the erosion of our most treasured right to privacy from government intrusion, and we have endured. Friends let the rain fall if it must. I am not afraid. I am an American. \n I’ve come to hate my body and all that it requires of me in this world …  \n                   Cindy was the speaker that first day I walked into the basement of Christ’s church. She sat cross-legged in the overstuffed chair at the corner of our circle looking like she got into a bout with a pit bull. Her lip was split, and her eyes blackened and purple, separated by a narrow white bandage across the bridge of her nose. Everyone was listening intently to what appeared to be a young woman in the “hot seat”, a box of tissue in her lap, sputtering in a little-girl voice about her boyfriend. \n  “After\nI informed him about my upcoming operation in Montreal, he made it abundantly\nclear he did not want to ever see me again. He broke my nose. It wasn’t\npretty,” she said and dabbed a dry eye with a tissue.  \n “He knocked out two of my front teeth. I had\nto scramble around on the floor after he had gone, looking for them so the\ndentist could put them back in.”  \n I had pictured a\nbunch of middle-aged men trying to dress like the woman of their dreams. Lost\nsouls trying to reinvent themselves into some idyllic embodiment of femininity\nthat they imagined when they were teenagers, before puberty rubbed them the\nwrong way. Instead, there was Cindy with her long brown hair tucked behind each\near, in her too-long sweater and a pair of thread-bare stirrups looking like a\nrebellious adolescent. When I found out she was a mechanic for a Sears Auto\nCenter, there was a connection. I was not just surprised but ecstatic. I felt\nthere may be hope for me yet.  \n Caught up in the\neuphoria, I asked her to lunch. I wanted to know more. We went to a small deli\non the outskirts of town. No one gave us a second look. Two girlfriends out to\nlunch.  \n Afterward, I let\nher drive my sporty 5-speed Honda Civic at top speed through the rolling hills\nof West Hartford to an apartment she shared with Laura. The two of them plied\nme with whiskey and wine, dressed me up like a prostitute and took me out to a\ngay bar near Amherst.  \n I woke up naked\nbetween them in an unfamiliar bed that smelled like sweat and vomit. I dressed\nquickly and drove back to Vermont. I barely glanced in her direction since that\nfirst meeting. It wasn’t long into my transition that I realized not every\nmember of my support group was the same kind of crazy as me.  \n  Traci was one of the first like me that I had met. At five feet four inches tall with diminutive features and a lovely face, she was that hot new model everyone at the XX Club aspired to be—no matter what variety of fruit they were. Traci  almost a half-million before coming into the XX Club. She and I were more financially stable than most of the others. It gave us some perks. Joe, the person I would eventually move in with, was more scrutinized by the gatekeepers. The clinic made him get his wife to sign off on his hormone shots, but he was undaunted.  \n “They pay more attention to me than you guys,”\nhe laughed. \n Canon Clinton\nJones, the club’s co-founder and social worker, usually sat in\none of the chairs facing the door and smiled at me and the others as we came\nin. Traci compared him to Saint Peter thinning out the flock of lost souls as\nthey came up to the pearly gates. He seldom spoke unless someone had a question\nfor him. He sat quietly, small white hands folded neatly on his lap, legs\ncrossed at the knee and observed while Jennifer, our club president, ran the\nmeeting. Canon Jones was there, he reminded us, to help us help ourselves. Our\njob was not so much to learn how to become women, but to unlearn all the years\nof living behind a mask of masculinity.  \n Jennifer\ndescribed it as peeling an onion, one layer at a time. It\nwould bring tears, but it was necessary before you could find that tender\nheart. Jennifer loved metaphors. She usually misquoted or mixed them up in an\nendearing sort of way. She was soft-spoken and plain and didn’t wear much\nmakeup. Her graying blond hair was tied up in a bun or stuck under some frumpy\nhat, and she always showed up in a long skirt and loose knit sweater like some\nold hippie chick. She looked like the grown-up version of Annie Hall.  \n Jennifer was one\nof the oldest members of the club and the main topic of conversation during our\nbreaks. No one was certain whether she had had SRS or not, but everyone held\nher in high esteem. We all knew her intentions were good. Besides, Canon Jones,\nand one of the former members who presided over my first meeting before leaving\nto parts unknown, she was one of the few people that appeared to care about our\nprogress and tried to be comforting.  \n She used to be an\nengineer at a big firm in Manhattan until she walked into the office one day\nwith her thinning blond hair tied back in a bun behind her head and in a long,\nknit skirt and cowl-neck sweater. Her partners called her into the boardroom\nand offered her an early retirement package she could not refuse.  \n When she was not\nrunning our meetings or arguing with her live-in girlfriend Julie, she stayed\nhome by a phone in her anteroom waiting for a call from her son. Gossip had it,\nwhen Jennifer’s ex-wife informed the boy what was going on with his father, he\nnever returned home from Penn State.  \n The greatest part\nof the gossip however was Julie, an ex-priest. She was a bit disconcerting to\nbe around. It was bad enough for most to descend into the bowels of a church\ndressed in ways that could get you arrested in the 1990’s and share intimate\nsecrets with complete strangers but she made it even more uncomfortable.  \n Julie was that\nnun from Hell, the one who dragged you out of your seat by the ear and stood\nyou in front of the entire class telling you that your zipper was open and\nforbade you to look down to see if it really was. Not only did her outfit\nresemble the Carmelite nuns that taught me for the first eight years of my\nacademic life, her mannerisms reminded me of my Seventh-grade teacher, Sister\nAloysius, right down to the nervous tic of her mouth whenever she scolded you\nfor slouching in your chair.  \n With the\nexception of Julie’s starched blouse that was usually\npetrified-white, she wore black like a second skin. Black dress, black sweater,\nblack-framed glasses, and her black hair tied back with a black ribbon. She\nwore black nun-shoes—the kind with a thick heel and blunt toe. Julie and\nJennifer lived together in Jennifer’s large stately home off King’s Highway in\nan old established neighborhood in Bridgeport.  \n Julie was still on the books as the club vice\npresident but seldom showed for meetings. When someone inquired, Jennifer would\nsay, “Busy bees must make honey while they can,” or “busy is, busy does.” It\ndidn’t really answer the question but stifled any further inquiry.  \n Most were thankful she didn’t come. No one\nwanted to be reminded to keep their legs closed or crossed at the knee if you\nwere wearing a dress or skirt or stopped at some penultimate moment at the\nclimax of a personal story shared with the group for the first time. She would\ntell someone if she thought the subject matter was inappropriate even on breaks\nand no one wanted to be reminded again and again that this was not a place to\nmake “new best friends” simply when you stopped to talk to someone after a meeting.     \n Traci’s boots\nwere on the floor under her chair. Her feet securely tucked up under her while\nshe huddled under her parka with the collar pulled up to her chin. Her breath\nfloated aimlessly up through the loose fabric. She caught me staring and gave\nme the thumbs up. She approved of my casual look—a pair of my daughter Jackie’s\nold jeans hugged my thighs and a long red sweater clung to my budding round\nbosom. If you could pass in androgynous clothing, you had made it.  \n Traci said no matter how good we look someone\nalways sees who we once were. Our past creeps through. My eyes narrowed on her\npretty face when she said it. I found it hard to tell the difference between\nher and any of my sisters. She was, without question, as cute as any teenage prom\nqueen.  \n “Don’t worry, you’ll get there. Give them\nmoaning whores time to do their magic.”  \n That’s what she called hormones. I was never\nquite sure whether she laughed at my insecurity or her little pundit. \n It was Traci who convinced me to move in with\nJoe for my year of living in my chosen gender, as required by the program.  \n “You can cart each other around from place to\nplace until all your surgeries are complete. No one can go through this alone.”\n \n When I asked who assisted her, she just\nsmiled. \n Traci planned on\ngoing deep stealth. She stayed to herself at meetings and avoided interaction\nwith anyone who might give her away. She barely talked to the others except\ncordially. Although not formally appointed, she was my mentor. By the time I\nmoved from Vermont to Hartford, she was halfway through with her ‘year\nof living dangerously’ as she called that time when we strapped our sex up\nbetween our legs and put on a dress, usually for the first time.  \n I was fortunate\nshe took me under her wing. I came dressed that first day in blue jeans and\nwork boots looking more like gay Bruce Springsteen than a Lola. I had no\nexperience dressing up as a girl except a few times on Halloween but that ended\nin the sixth grade, after my father told my mother I looked like a squirrel.\nAll I dared wear was a dab of mascara for fear of getting seen by someone I\nknew.  \n I had a key to my\nfriend, Frank’s, dental office in Brattleboro. He was never\nthere on weekends and I would stop by to use the bathroom and lightly line my\neyes with a black pencil and fluff out my curly hair with a pick, making my\nandrogynous appearance a little more feminine. But it wasn’t long after the\nhormones kicked in that my friends and people that I have known for years began\ntalking about me in those hushed whispers reserved for folks who claimed to be\nabducted by aliens. \n “Look at those two idiots.”  \n Traci jerked her head in the direction of two\nnewbies sitting across from us. She kept her voice low. \n “The tall blonde calls herself Proud Mary. She\nshowed up at the last meeting in a long red dress and a white sweater. A bloody\nmess.”  \n Traci had a euphemism for every regular in the\nclub and labeled the newbies if they came back a second time. Whenever she\ncalled me Saint Evelyn my stomach knotted but when she used the epithets that\nshe gave the regulars, I got more nervous.  \n Besides Joe, Jennifer and Scary Julie, the ex-priest, there was Sarah the eunuch and Laura the admirer. Cindy was the whiner of the group and Hawk-nose Kaitlyn was the youngest member to regularly attend our meetings. Both she and Cindy were in their late twenties and were rail thin. Traci called them Zeros. I didn’t know it referenced a dress size. I thought she was being derogatory, like all her other labels.  \n “Joe calls her Big Kathy,” I said referring to\nthe tall blonde. Traci was unconcerned with what other people thought. I never\nrealized how prejudiced she was towards our own kind.   \n “Like most of these freaks she works in IT and\nis married. Isn’t that Barbie?”  \n Traci nodded in the direction of a newbie in a\nwhite dress. \n “No, I don’t think so. She’s Hispanic. Her\neyes are slanted. Barbie had big eyes like the doll, remember. That’s why we\ncalled her that.” \n “Cripes! That’s right. It’s hard to keep track\nof all the freaks. Where do they all come from?”  \n Jennifer brought\nher finger up to her thin colorless lips. Petite Cindy was in the ‘hot\nseat’ blubbering something about stenosis and an opening the size of a pencil\nnub. She was always crying or feigning emotional trauma to draw sympathy. Her\nlarge dark eyes looked down into her empty lap. Cindy spoke in a\nmonotone-droll-little-girl voice. Her eyes were wide-open and dry. There were\nno tears, but people around her, especially the newbies, feigned empathy as\nthough it was expected of them.  \n People didn’t\nnormally cry at meetings. Most of our tears were used up long ago as children.\nSelf-pity is unusual for a tranny who survived past puberty. It succumbed to an\nemotional cancer that spread quietly into the trauma of our teen years when we\nnoticed the developing bodies of the girls born in the right body. Pity was\nreplaced by an emptiness and self-loathing before we became adults.  \n Some had a chip on their shoulder, but when\nmost first came to the club and realized they were not alone they were elated\nor relieved. No one cried in a meeting unless it was a story about them. How\nshe was molested by a family member or sitting in a warm bath at the age of six\ncontemplating how to cut off the male genitals that did not belong on her body\nwithout bleeding to death.   \n Jennifer liked\nCindy for some reason. She often sat in the hot seat. Cindy retold her story\nabout her botched operation by an incompetent Montreal surgeon at almost every\nmeeting. We were the experimental people. Dr. Menard had tried a new spiral\ngrafting procedure to improve on the healing process of the neo-vagina.\nHowever, something went horribly wrong, if you believed Cindy.  \n “Cindy is a drama queen,” Traci said. She\nthought Cindy failed to follow directions and insert the prosthetic device into\nthe raw wound twice a day to keep it open until it healed. I pictured the\nlittle girl in The Exorcist stabbing\nher crotch when she said it and winced. Physical pain to pacify our emotional\ntrauma. \n  Sarah’s\nhair was cut short like a boy’s but he looked and sounded like a woman because\nhe never went through puberty. He contracted syphilis when he was 9. That’s\nwhen his mother’s boyfriend moved into their trailer. Sarah told me he used to\nsneak into her room at night when her mother passed out from the drugs that he\ngave her.  \n “He was a sick man.”  \n She almost\nsounded sorry for him.  \n I felt sorry for\nSarah. She didn’t talk much. When she did, it was usually to\ncertain people like me or Laura, who she moved in with when she came up from\nthe New York City. Laura and Sarah were not real members of the XX Club.\nNeither were candidates for sexual reassignment, but Canon Jones let them join\nthe support group whenever they felt like killing themselves.   \n Sarah didn’t\nmake eye contact. She usually looked down at her feet when she spoke or at her\nlap if she was sitting. Her voice was low, and you’d have to strain to hear it.\nShe didn’t talk much to the others, but for some reason, she did talk to me.  \n Everyone seemed to confide in me and tell me\nthings I did not want to hear, especially Joe. Sometimes people told me too\nmuch—those dirty little secrets that should be locked in a box in the back of a\ncloset or swept under a bed. I kept a smile pressed to my lips and listened and\ntried not to think about how it would affect me.  \n From meeting to\nmeeting, I barely remembered the ones I saw from the previous month. A handful\nof newbies came and went from time to time, but no one noticed when they didn’t\nshow up again. We were keenly aware that only a handful would make it out alive\nand were relieved when we were still sitting in that imperfect circle of\nchairs.  \n One week several\nnewbies appeared at once. A Konstanz with a “Z” she said,\nthen a Bronwyn, and our hawk-nosed Katlyn paraded in wearing heels and heavy\nmakeup probably for the first time. The more flamboyant monikers revealed a\nchange in attitude among the community as if they were no longer ashamed of\nbeing born odd. They reinvented themselves like children playing in a\nmake-believe world pretending to be something different than they were born—not\nquite a white knight, a soldier, or cowboy but almost always a damsel in\ndistress.  \n I didn’t\nknow why anyone would want to be a victim but some of the newbies tended to\nrevel in it like it was their destiny. They came in to challenge the\ngatekeepers, who tried without success to screen them out. The clinic staff\nfound the majority of the support group were these new gender-warriors, many\nalso in need of services. They did not want to change their sex. They\ndisappeared at an alarming rate when they or Canon Jones realized the program\nwas not designed to accommodate them. \n We turned off\nreality. When someone was missing at the next meeting, we did not ask\nquestions. They could be dead or just decided to revert back to the real world\nand hang up their heels for a while. We never knew. We’d see a newbie sitting\nin a chair where the recently deceased should be and we’d go on acting as\nthough they showed up again—transformed. \n I attended\nseveral meetings, twice a month, while still living at home in Vermont. But as\nthe hormonal therapy progressed, and I began to look and feel differently, I\nknew I had to leave the safety of my home and family if I was to ever become\nthe person, I knew I was meant to be.   \n\n#\n\n\n\n \n By: Michelle Berthiaume \n        *** Soon to be released  *** \n The 1990s was a dangerous time to go against their Makers design … \n  \n Speak to me dear poet,\nlet me hear your gentle voice before the dawn and regret seeps in through the tattered curtains of my life.\nLet your words pour through my weary bones, refresh my soul with your divine,\nI am, for these fine moments before the light, your instrument,\nplay hard until comes the day with all its revelry and spite.\nLeave your mark upon me so all will know that I was yours and you were mine this last beloved night. \n Speak to me dear poet,\nlet me hear your gentle voice before the dawn and regret seeps in through the tattered curtains of my life.\nLet your words pour through my weary bones, refresh my soul with your divine,\nI am, for these fine moments before the light, your instrument,\nplay hard until comes the day with all its revelry and spite.\nLeave your mark upon me so all will know that I was yours and you were mine this last beloved night. \n A Daughter is a rose without thorns . . . – Emily Michelle McNamee \n ___________ \n When he died, Da was only forty-five. They lied to Ma and said he fell off his horse. I knew it was not the fall that killed him. Not that a games-keeper for the Kings’ estate in County Cork could not fall off his horse. I’d seen Da do it after a visit to Killian’s Pub but I’d seen the leaves on the morn of his death and knew. The lord of the manor had come all the way from England for the annual hunt. He come into the kitchen and had me do his reading when Da was outside hitching up the wagon. I curtsied and told him: “Nah, Sir, I am forbade to read the leaves. If Father McGinnis finds out, there’d be the devil to pay.” Lord Kensington laughed. \n “It’s not for real, Lass. It’s for entertainment.” Although I was barely eleven, my skills with alchemy and other gifts were legendary among the Baile. “Come now. Let’s see what ya can do. You are the seventh daughter of the seventh daughter, are you not?” \n I nodded and fetched the pot from the stove and prepared his cup. I no sooner poured the water over the dried leaves and the chill fell upon me. I shuddered. He laughed and helped me steady the pot back onto the stove. His hands stayed on my shoulders and slid down to cover my hands. They were soft for a man. Not a callous or scar on them. he twirled me around as if to study me. Then of a sudden he let go and sat back down. His eyes bade me to go on.  \n When he was through his breakfast including the tea I poured him he put his cup on the table, sat back and bade me to sit upon his lap. My sisters stood in the corner staring at their shoes. As lord of the manor our whole family were his servants. None dare deny his command. I stared into the bottom of the empty cup staring at the pattern the leaves had formed. when they all had seemed to settle into place, it presented itself in Olde English, a language of his ancestors that I was least familiar. As a daughter of the head games-keeper, I had learned all manner of things beyond my station to assist the ladies of the men who came to the manor for the hunt. From the various guests I learned French, Welch, Gaelic, and some Olde English. It was the hardest to learn, taught me by the Lord’s spinster sister, Cecile, who used to accompany him in the years when she could ride.  \n “Well, girl, hurry up. I don’t have all day. We got game to catch.” My sisters snickered nervously from the corner by the stove and his man, Charles, who tended to his personal needs, stood somberly to one side holding his boots.  \n “It’s hard, Sir. It’s in a difficult tongue. I have to wait for the images to form in me brain. You have a different linage. I—” I stopped suddenly when it came to me as if spoken into my ear by some faerie passing through. “A man will die on the hunt this day,” I cried in a voice much too old for me and that vibrated as if more than one person was speaking from far away. I pulled away from his grasp. Startled by my outburst, he let go of me and I landed on the floor on the pads of my feet. He held the table to steady himself as he stood. Perhaps he thought I meant him.  \n “Nonsense, girl.” He shouted. “You disappoint me.” I saw his blue eyes widen before he ran out the back door in his stocking feet with Charles chasing after him. I ran out the front where I knew Da was waiting with the wagon. It was his job to show the Lord and his party where the beasts would be hiding and carry back the prizes of the day in his wagon.  \n “Da, don’t go!” I screamed. Dark clouds were already forming on the horizon above the gables.  \n “Katie, calm down. We’ll be back ‘afore the sun falls. Tell your mother to prepare stock for venison.” He was laughing at me. I nearly took a fall. “It’s a fine day. Cernunnos smiles upon the McNamee. A big white on the mountain goin’ a fall. I know—” \n “The stag is in the heather, not on the hill and ’tis an omen, Da.” I finish for him. It got his attention. I’d broke my promise. He knew. His face turned ashen then red.  \n “Katie, go back inside. I’ll deal with ya when I return.” \n “No, don’t go.”   \n “Katie!” He raised the whip in his hand then clutched his chest with the other. I ran back inside to tell Ma. But it was too late. Pa was already chasing his big white stag in the heather. \n It was dusk when the horn sounded and the hunt was over. I sat stone still on the swing on the back porch. I hovered, bare feet dangling over the edge, looking out over the heather, a Norse wind teasing the ends of my skirts then it lifted me. I am on the wagon beside my Da. We sit in silence looking down across the spotted back of Martha, feeling the warmth of the late afternoon sun on our faces as she trots down the lane toward home. He looks happy to see me. All my witchery forgotten. He looks to the sea toward Neamh. His old eyes smiling. He squeezes me hand and together we begin: “And I’d give the world if she could sing, that song to me this day.”  \n   \n Her name is Jen Rose. She is my daughter and I have learned a lot from her on how to be an  empowered woman in an ever-changing world. Even as a child her inner strength and compassion radiated to everyone around her. Somehow she managed to rise up from being a petite introverted girl to become the hero others, boys and girls alike, admired and strove to emulate. Granted, her ubringing was not conventional. The Airforce moved us around the country when she was small but prior to starting school we settled down in a small town in Central Vermont where they had a progressive school system. She began playing sports,  particularly soccer, since she was first able to walk. I coached her and her younger sister, Jaq, and dozens of other children in a youth sports program designed to introduce, the then foreign sport, to a city that prided itself on it’s hockey, football and baseball championship teams. By the time Jen Rose was in seventh grade she was playing softball, basketball, bowling, track and soccer nearly year round along with her baby sister and began to gain regional attention. When she broke her leg in a soccer match shortly before basketball season she asked the doctor for a walking cast so she could keep active. I don’t think the doctor anticipated she would be clip-clipping up and down a court in front of cheering crowds to help her team to victory. A week after the cast came off she called me on the telephone and told me had assembled the first ever girls’s team to compete in a summer soccer league and then informed me that I was the coach. That summer both Jaq and Jen Rose were scouted and picked up by an international girls youth soccer team from the state’s largest city. We traveled to Canada where both Jen Rose and Jaq distinguished themselves as two of the state’s premiere players to contend with. Jen at midfield and Jaq, who had shot up to be the tallest girl in her class, as goalie. The area newspapers adored Jen Rose and covered her extensively as she progressed. She was hailed as the best female athlete to hit Central Vermont and filled a scrap book of clippings more than an inch thick. Despite all of the adoration she never let it go to head and always praised the other players on her teams. She managed to keep up her grades to remain in the top third academically in her class and in her senior year she wrote, directed, acted and choreographed the Senior school production of Let’s Put on a Play with her sister, Jaq,  in the lead role. That same year she and her sisters bowling team won the state finals. Immediately after the last ball rolled down the lane, we drove 2 hours to Smith College in Massachusetts so that she could compete in the regional track meet. She took third in the 440 meter race.  The day that Coach Ventriglia called to inform her that she had a position on the Lady Knights, West Points’ prestigious women’s soccer team, Jen Rose, and her little sister, Jaq, played in a match that would culminate their illustrious athletic careers at Spalding Regional High school. With several broken meta tarsals in both feet, in double over time and with one player down, Jen  came out of sweeper position to rush down the field to score the winning goal against a team that hadn’t lost a game in three consequetive seasons. The papers credited the win to her and “Jen’s little sister”. Jaq earned the title of “spider woman” for the countless spectacular saves in net. That Spring, Jaq, requested she play on a separate softball team citing she as tired of being referred to as: Jen’s Little sister.  As fate would have it the two teams were pitted against each other in the softball state finals with the winner representing Vermont in the regional at Amherst. Jen’s team went to the regional tournament. She weathered her Parents divorce the breakup of her family and the trials and tribulations of being one of the few female cadets at USMA at West Point during a difficult period and graduated in 1997. She went onto play soccer for the Army winning a gold medal before she hung up her cleats. She served along side her little sister, in many overseas campaigns including Bosnia, Kuwait,  and took over a command in Baghdad before leaving the service to raise her own family.  Although, her athletic and military careers were impressive and as her parent made me proud of her accomplishments. The one thing that will for her stand out in my mind was the time we took her and some of her friends to Ben \u0026 Jerry’s for ice cream. When we were ordering at the counter we discovered she was missing. We frantically ran outside and spotted her across the street assisting an elderly man with his groceries. I am so very proud and grateful to God, she is my daughter. She now has two daughters of her own she raises with her military husband. She put away her scrap book, medals and trophys. Keeping them out of sight, in some drawer of an old dresser and on a shelf collecting dust in the back of her closet, where they can do no harm. She is trying not to influence her daughters or make them feel they must compete or follow in her wake. When I tell them their mother was a superstar they look at me and smile as though I’ve told them some fairy tale. To them, she is a Wonder Woman because she’s: Mom.  \n A wealthy merchant bought land in a village so he could build a house overlooking a great mountain. He hired a magic elf to construct his home and gave him the plans. When it was finished the man noticed the elf had followed his plans perfectly except there were only two windows both placed side by side facing the mountain. The man confronted the elf and demanded an explanation. “Why did you only put in two windows when I told you I wanted to see the world in all its grandeur!” The elf said: “I followed your instructions. One window is when you wish to see the world as it is. The other is for those days you wake up and see the world as you wish it to be.” Still furious when the elf left he decided to see which window gave him the best view. There were no markings to indicate which was the wishing view. They looked identical and when he looked out he saw the same view of the mountain. \n A week later he saw the elf again on the street and the elf asked him how he liked his view. \n The man retorted: “Each morning I wake up and go to the window on the left and look out and then the one on the right and see the same mountain. There is no difference.” \n “You’re not wishing hard enough. Go home and give it another try. This time think about the way you would like it to look before openning the curtains,” the elf said then disappeared into the crowded market. \n So the man went home and this time he thought about the wild flowers he used to see growing on the side of the mountain when he was a boy but when he opened his eyes he saw only the same stark view of the mountain from both windows. Still angry with the elf he went back to the town and when he couldn’t find him he bought a ton of wildflower seeds from a farmer and hired workers to plant them on the side of the mountain. \n In the Spring he marveled at the sight of the mountain with its splendid colors from all of the wildflowers he had planted but when he looked out of the window on the right the view was the same. \n When the man saw the elf on the street that morning he confronted him. “Elf, I did as you instructed but the views from each window are the same.” \n “Tell me, my friend, is the view the same as when I constructed your house?” \n The wealthy man smiled. \n Each and every night, without fail\nI breach the inky darkness lunging dripping wet,\nI fall beneath the fragile surface of a dream, transcending space and time, without regret,\nSearching and soaring mile after scathing mile, beneath a scarlet moon, \n Falling and melding into the endless void \n to find you … \n MOM: Here you can have these chocolate covered nuts if you like.\nMe: “What are they?” I ask, as she pours me a handful. \n Mom: IT’S some kind of gormet candy I picked up at the store. supposed to be chocolate covered nuts but taste like coffee. \n  \n Me: I thought you liked candy. Save it for the movies.\nMom: Well, I don’t like them.\nMe: Why not? What’s wrong with them? And why are you giving them to me?\nMom: They taste good but they make me diggity.\nMe: Diggity?!\nMom: Yeah, I.must be allergic to these nuts bc after I ate some I felt irritable and couldn’t stop movin around. I walked up to the kitchen four times last night. Only slept a half hour. Couldn’t sleep.\nMe: They’re not nuts, Mom. They’re coffee beans. Full of caffeine. If I had one, I’d be awake till midnight.\nMom: Oh …\nMe: Where’s the rest of them? There’s only a few left in this bag.\nMom: That explains why I only slept a half hour all night.\nMe: Give them to me. No more gormet chocolate covered coffee beans for you. You’re 86, lucky your heart didnt give out.\nMom: maybe you can give the candy to April and Jim …\nMe: oh, boy! \n Dark days are merely days with less sunshine in them. We all have them. Some more than others. Addiction, neglect, self-loathing, fears and maladies of all types. They creep into our lives when we least suspect, sometimes right after having a baby and no one fully understand why. Everyone deals with it differently. I use prayer, meditation and exercise to stimulate endorphins in the brain to feel better. Writing or some other form of artistic expression also helps particularly in those darker days with less light. We used to live with layers of generations in one home or close by and the frequent contact of our social circle often made one feel less alone. But alone is how you must face your problem in the final scheme of things bc even those you feel comfort and cherish advice from cannot live your life for you. You have to choose if you want to feel better. No one can do that for you. Find solace in knowing that you have already accomplished much more in your lifetime than many and have friends and family who love you dearly. Take that love and stop feeling you can’t give back a hundredfold of what they give you. A doctor once told me after my first suicide attempt at thirteen, to run and not stop until you can’t. As long as you can keep running, you’ll find something in life worth running to. GOOD luck. Feel better soon. \n All my love and encouragement, \n FyrecurlShare \n  \n Tweet \n  \n  \n Email \n Print \n  \n  \n Share on Tumblr \n  \n  \n  \n Share \n  \n Tweet \n  \n  \n Email \n Print \n  \n  \n Share on Tumblr \n  \n  \n  \n Share \n  \n Tweet \n  \n  \n Email \n Print \n  \n  \n Share on Tumblr \n  \n  \n  \n Share \n  \n Tweet \n  \n  \n Email \n Print \n  \n  \n Share on Tumblr \n  \n  \n  \n  \n Share \n  \n Tweet \n  \n  \n Email \n Print \n  \n  \n Share on Tumblr \n  \n  \n  \n Share \n  \n Tweet \n  \n  \n Email \n Print \n  \n  \n Share on Tumblr \n  \n  \n  \n Share \n  \n Tweet \n  \n  \n Email \n Print \n  \n  \n Share on Tumblr \n  \n  \n  \n Share \n  \n Tweet \n  \n  \n Email \n Print \n  \n  \n Share on Tumblr \n  \n  \n  \n Share \n  \n Tweet \n  \n  \n Email \n Print \n  \n  \n Share on Tumblr \n  \n  \n  \n Share \n  \n Tweet \n  \n  \n Email \n Print \n  \n  \n Share on Tumblr \n  \n  \n  \n Share \n  \n Tweet \n  \n  \n Email \n Print \n  \n  \n Share on Tumblr \n  \n  \n  \n Share \n  \n Tweet \n  \n  \n Email \n Print \n  \n  \n Share on Tumblr \n  \n  \n  \n Share \n  \n Tweet \n  \n  \n Email \n Print \n  \n  \n Share on Tumblr \n  \n  \n  \n Share \n  \n Tweet \n  \n  \n Email \n Print \n  \n  \n Share on Tumblr \n  \n  \n \n\t\n\t\tFeaturedDestiny’s Child\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\nAnd she stood above them on the ledge looking down\nDropping petals from marigolds and Pansies and a rose\nWatching them drift and twist slowly round\nWith fragile wings reaching for their destiny far below\n\n\n\nAnd when we got there she was already on the ground\nStaring up at us with a smile\nAs though she found the answer to her tears\nThere on her journey down\n\n\n\nThe one that evaded her all those years\nAnd stood there still and leaning over the rail did I\nWaiting for a sign that all was well\nLong and hard and cold watching her lie\n\n\n\nAnd among those broken blossoms where she fell\nShe did not stir nor waver once nor even sigh\nLying among the flowers that i gave her\nwhen i said farewell\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t__ATA.cmd.push(function() {\n\t\t\t\t\t__ATA.initDynamicSlot({\n\t\t\t\t\t\tid: 'atatags-26942-60a78fd2e6a57',\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlocation: 120,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tformFactor: '001',\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabel: {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttext: 'Advertisements',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcreative: {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treportAd: {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttext: 'Report this ad',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprivacySettings: {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttext: 'Privacy',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\tShare this:ShareTweetEmailPrintShare on TumblrLike this:Like Loading...\t\n\n\t\n\t\tPosted byFyrecurlDecember 2, 2016July 3, 2019Posted inDepression, feminism, Gender issues, LGBTQ, Love, Philosophy, Poetry, Romance, Women and Society, Writing1 Comment on Destiny’s Child\t\n \n \n\t\n\t\tFeaturedAmerica is Great.\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\tWhere there is fear there is hope, where there is darkness there is light, where there is suffering there is kindness, and where there is hate there is love.

We have done it most of our lives. Having felt a little sunshine these past 8 years it is only natural to want more when storm clouds threaten to disrupt our picnic. However remember when the rain cometh this time things are different. If we have learned one thing in all of those early years of struggle, we are not alone. Women and men, straight and not so straight of every color, ethnicity and religion have banded together as Americans to build a new future. We have sanged and danced in the streets like children, laughed and even cried over tragedies that have honed our multifaceted  character into one unified people for justice and principles that we claim unilaterally are: American. We have faced civil unrest, the enslavement of a people, bombing of churches, wars to end all wars, the unfair internment of some of our friends and neighbors of oriental decent, Stonewall, McCarthyism, the atrocities of Viet Nam, Watergate scandals, infidelities from our trusted officials too numerous to mention, and the fall of the twin towers which led to the erosion of our most treasured right to privacy from government intrusion, and we have endured. Friends let the rain fall if it must. I am not afraid.

She sat cross-legged in the overstuffed chair at the corner of our circle looking like she got into a bout with a pit bull. Her lip was split, and her eyes blackened and purple, separated by a narrow white bandage across the bridge of her nose. Everyone was listening intently to what appeared to be a young woman in the “hot seat”, a box of tissue in her lap, sputtering in a little-girl voice about her boyfriend.\n\n\n\n “After\nI informed him about my upcoming operation in Montreal, he made it abundantly\nclear he did not want to ever see me again. He broke my nose. It wasn’t\npretty,” she said and dabbed a dry eye with a tissue. \n\n\n\n“He knocked out two of my front teeth. I had\nto scramble around on the floor after he had gone, looking for them so the\ndentist could put them back in.” \n\n\n\nI had pictured a\nbunch of middle-aged men trying to dress like the woman of their dreams. Lost\nsouls trying to reinvent themselves into some idyllic embodiment of femininity\nthat they imagined when they were teenagers, before puberty rubbed them the\nwrong way. Instead, there was Cindy with her long brown hair tucked behind each\near, in her too-long sweater and a pair of thread-bare stirrups looking like a\nrebellious adolescent. When I found out she was a mechanic for a Sears Auto\nCenter, there was a connection. I was not just surprised but ecstatic. I felt\nthere may be hope for me yet. \n\n\n\nCaught up in the\neuphoria, I asked her to lunch. I wanted to know more. We went to a small deli\non the outskirts of town. No one gave us a second look. Two girlfriends out to\nlunch. \n\n\n\nAfterward, I let\nher drive my sporty 5-speed Honda Civic at top speed through the rolling hills\nof West Hartford to an apartment she shared with Laura. The two of them plied\nme with whiskey and wine, dressed me up like a prostitute and took me out to a\ngay bar near Amherst. \n\n\n\nI woke up naked\nbetween them in an unfamiliar bed that smelled like sweat and vomit. I dressed\nquickly and drove back to Vermont. I barely glanced in her direction since that\nfirst meeting. It wasn’t long into my transition that I realized not every\nmember of my support group was the same kind of crazy as me. \n\n\n\n Traci was one of the first like me that I had met. At five feet four inches tall with diminutive features and a lovely face, she was that hot new model everyone at the XX Club aspired to be—no matter what variety of fruit they were. Traci  almost a half-million before coming into the XX Club. She and I were more financially stable than most of the others. It gave us some perks. Joe, the person I would eventually move in with, was more scrutinized by the gatekeepers. The clinic made him get his wife to sign off on his hormone shots, but he was undaunted. \n\n\n\n“They pay more attention to me than you guys,”\nhe laughed.\n\n\n\nCanon Clinton\nJones, the club’s co-founder and social worker, usually sat in\none of the chairs facing the door and smiled at me and the others as we came\nin. Traci compared him to Saint Peter thinning out the flock of lost souls as\nthey came up to the pearly gates. He seldom spoke unless someone had a question\nfor him. He sat quietly, small white hands folded neatly on his lap, legs\ncrossed at the knee and observed while Jennifer, our club president, ran the\nmeeting. Canon Jones was there, he reminded us, to help us help ourselves. Our\njob was not so much to learn how to become women, but to unlearn all the years\nof living behind a mask of masculinity. \n\n\n\nJennifer\ndescribed it as peeling an onion, one layer at a time. It\nwould bring tears, but it was necessary before you could find that tender\nheart. Jennifer loved metaphors. She usually misquoted or mixed them up in an\nendearing sort of way. She was soft-spoken and plain and didn’t wear much\nmakeup. Her graying blond hair was tied up in a bun or stuck under some frumpy\nhat, and she always showed up in a long skirt and loose knit sweater like some\nold hippie chick. She looked like the grown-up version of Annie Hall. \n\n\n\nJennifer was one\nof the oldest members of the club and the main topic of conversation during our\nbreaks. No one was certain whether she had had SRS or not, but everyone held\nher in high esteem. We all knew her intentions were good. Besides, Canon Jones,\nand one of the former members who presided over my first meeting before leaving\nto parts unknown, she was one of the few people that appeared to care about our\nprogress and tried to be comforting. \n\n\n\nShe used to be an\nengineer at a big firm in Manhattan until she walked into the office one day\nwith her thinning blond hair tied back in a bun behind her head and in a long,\nknit skirt and cowl-neck sweater. Her partners called her into the boardroom\nand offered her an early retirement package she could not refuse. \n\n\n\nWhen she was not\nrunning our meetings or arguing with her live-in girlfriend Julie, she stayed\nhome by a phone in her anteroom waiting for a call from her son. Gossip had it,\nwhen Jennifer’s ex-wife informed the boy what was going on with his father, he\nnever returned home from Penn State. \n\n\n\nThe greatest part\nof the gossip however was Julie, an ex-priest. She was a bit disconcerting to\nbe around. It was bad enough for most to descend into the bowels of a church\ndressed in ways that could get you arrested in the 1990’s and share intimate\nsecrets with complete strangers but she made it even more uncomfortable. \n\n\n\nJulie was that\nnun from Hell, the one who dragged you out of your seat by the ear and stood\nyou in front of the entire class telling you that your zipper was open and\nforbade you to look down to see if it really was. Not only did her outfit\nresemble the Carmelite nuns that taught me for the first eight years of my\nacademic life, her mannerisms reminded me of my Seventh-grade teacher, Sister\nAloysius, right down to the nervous tic of her mouth whenever she scolded you\nfor slouching in your chair. \n\n\n\nWith the\nexception of Julie’s starched blouse that was usually\npetrified-white, she wore black like a second skin. Black dress, black sweater,\nblack-framed glasses, and her black hair tied back with a black ribbon. She\nwore black nun-shoes—the kind with a thick heel and blunt toe. Julie and\nJennifer lived together in Jennifer’s large stately home off King’s Highway in\nan old established neighborhood in Bridgeport. \n\n\n\nJulie was still on the books as the club vice\npresident but seldom showed for meetings. When someone inquired, Jennifer would\nsay, “Busy bees must make honey while they can,” or “busy is, busy does.” It\ndidn’t really answer the question but stifled any further inquiry. \n\n\n\nMost were thankful she didn’t come. No one\nwanted to be reminded to keep their legs closed or crossed at the knee if you\nwere wearing a dress or skirt or stopped at some penultimate moment at the\nclimax of a personal story shared with the group for the first time. She would\ntell someone if she thought the subject matter was inappropriate even on breaks\nand no one wanted to be reminded again and again that this was not a place to\nmake “new best friends” simply when you stopped to talk to someone after a meeting.    \n\n\n\nTraci’s boots\nwere on the floor under her chair. Her feet securely tucked up under her while\nshe huddled under her parka with the collar pulled up to her chin. Her breath\nfloated aimlessly up through the loose fabric. She caught me staring and gave\nme the thumbs up. She approved of my casual look—a pair of my daughter Jackie’s\nold jeans hugged my thighs and a long red sweater clung to my budding round\nbosom. If you could pass in androgynous clothing, you had made it. \n\n\n\nTraci said no matter how good we look someone\nalways sees who we once were. Our past creeps through. My eyes narrowed on her\npretty face when she said it. I found it hard to tell the difference between\nher and any of my sisters. She was, without question, as cute as any teenage prom\nqueen. \n\n\n\n“Don’t worry, you’ll get there. Give them\nmoaning whores time to do their magic.” \n\n\n\nThat’s what she called hormones. I was never\nquite sure whether she laughed at my insecurity or her little pundit.\n\n\n\nIt was Traci who convinced me to move in with\nJoe for my year of living in my chosen gender, as required by the program. \n\n\n\n“You can cart each other around from place to\nplace until all your surgeries are complete. No one can go through this alone.”\n\n\n\n\nWhen I asked who assisted her, she just\nsmiled.\n\n\n\nTraci planned on\ngoing deep stealth. She stayed to herself at meetings and avoided interaction\nwith anyone who might give her away. She barely talked to the others except\ncordially. Although not formally appointed, she was my mentor. By the time I\nmoved from Vermont to Hartford, she was halfway through with her ‘year\nof living dangerously’ as she called that time when we strapped our sex up\nbetween our legs and put on a dress, usually for the first time. \n\n\n\nI was fortunate\nshe took me under her wing. I came dressed that first day in blue jeans and\nwork boots looking more like gay Bruce Springsteen than a Lola. I had no\nexperience dressing up as a girl except a few times on Halloween but that ended\nin the sixth grade, after my father told my mother I looked like a squirrel.\nAll I dared wear was a dab of mascara for fear of getting seen by someone I\nknew. \n\n\n\nI had a key to my\nfriend, Frank’s, dental office in Brattleboro. He was never\nthere on weekends and I would stop by to use the bathroom and lightly line my\neyes with a black pencil and fluff out my curly hair with a pick, making my\nandrogynous appearance a little more feminine. But it wasn’t long after the\nhormones kicked in that my friends and people that I have known for years began\ntalking about me in those hushed whispers reserved for folks who claimed to be\nabducted by aliens.\n\n\n\n“Look at those two idiots.” \n\n\n\nTraci jerked her head in the direction of two\nnewbies sitting across from us. She kept her voice low.\n\n\n\n“The tall blonde calls herself Proud Mary. She\nshowed up at the last meeting in a long red dress and a white sweater. A bloody\nmess.” \n\n\n\nTraci had a euphemism for every regular in the\nclub and labeled the newbies if they came back a second time. Whenever she\ncalled me Saint Evelyn my stomach knotted but when she used the epithets that\nshe gave the regulars, I got more nervous. \n\n\n\nBesides Joe, Jennifer and Scary Julie, the ex-priest, there was Sarah the eunuch and Laura the admirer. Cindy was the whiner of the group and Hawk-nose Kaitlyn was the youngest member to regularly attend our meetings. Both she and Cindy were in their late twenties and were rail thin. Traci called them Zeros. I didn’t know it referenced a dress size. I thought she was being derogatory, like all her other labels. \n\n\n\n“Joe calls her Big Kathy,” I said referring to\nthe tall blonde. Traci was unconcerned with what other people thought. I never\nrealized how prejudiced she was towards our own kind.  \n\n\n\n“Like most of these freaks she works in IT and\nis married. Isn’t that Barbie?” \n\n\n\nTraci nodded in the direction of a newbie in a\nwhite dress.\n\n\n\n“No, I don’t think so. She’s Hispanic. Her\neyes are slanted. Barbie had big eyes like the doll, remember. That’s why we\ncalled her that.”\n\n\n\n“Cripes! That’s right. It’s hard to keep track\nof all the freaks. Where do they all come from?” \n\n\n\nJennifer brought\nher finger up to her thin colorless lips. Petite Cindy was in the ‘hot\nseat’ blubbering something about stenosis and an opening the size of a pencil\nnub. She was always crying or feigning emotional trauma to draw sympathy. Her\nlarge dark eyes looked down into her empty lap. Cindy spoke in a\nmonotone-droll-little-girl voice. Her eyes were wide-open and dry. There were\nno tears, but people around her, especially the newbies, feigned empathy as\nthough it was expected of them. \n\n\n\nPeople didn’t\nnormally cry at meetings. Most of our tears were used up long ago as children.\nSelf-pity is unusual for a tranny who survived past puberty. It succumbed to an\nemotional cancer that spread quietly into the trauma of our teen years when we\nnoticed the developing bodies of the girls born in the right body. Pity was\nreplaced by an emptiness and self-loathing before we became adults. \n\n\n\nSome had a chip on their shoulder, but when\nmost first came to the club and realized they were not alone they were elated\nor relieved. No one cried in a meeting unless it was a story about them. How\nshe was molested by a family member or sitting in a warm bath at the age of six\ncontemplating how to cut off the male genitals that did not belong on her body\nwithout bleeding to death.  \n\n\n\nJennifer liked\nCindy for some reason. She often sat in the hot seat. Cindy retold her story\nabout her botched operation by an incompetent Montreal surgeon at almost every\nmeeting. We were the experimental people. Dr. Menard had tried a new spiral\ngrafting procedure to improve on the healing process of the neo-vagina.\nHowever, something went horribly wrong, if you believed Cindy. \n\n\n\n“Cindy is a drama queen,” Traci said. She\nthought Cindy failed to follow directions and insert the prosthetic device into\nthe raw wound twice a day to keep it open until it healed. I pictured the\nlittle girl in The Exorcist stabbing\nher crotch when she said it and winced. Physical pain to pacify our emotional\ntrauma.\n\n\n\n Sarah’s\nhair was cut short like a boy’s but he looked and sounded like a woman because\nhe never went through puberty. He contracted syphilis when he was 9. That’s\nwhen his mother’s boyfriend moved into their trailer. Sarah told me he used to\nsneak into her room at night when her mother passed out from the drugs that he\ngave her. \n\n\n\n“He was a sick man.” \n\n\n\nShe almost\nsounded sorry for him. \n\n\n\nI felt sorry for\nSarah. She didn’t talk much. When she did, it was usually to\ncertain people like me or Laura, who she moved in with when she came up from\nthe New York City. Laura and Sarah were not real members of the XX Club.\nNeither were candidates for sexual reassignment, but Canon Jones let them join\nthe support group whenever they felt like killing themselves.  \n\n\n\nSarah didn’t\nmake eye contact. She usually looked down at her feet when she spoke or at her\nlap if she was sitting. Her voice was low, and you’d have to strain to hear it.\nShe didn’t talk much to the others, but for some reason, she did talk to me. \n\n\n\nEveryone seemed to confide in me and tell me\nthings I did not want to hear, especially Joe. Sometimes people told me too\nmuch—those dirty little secrets that should be locked in a box in the back of a\ncloset or swept under a bed. I kept a smile pressed to my lips and listened and\ntried not to think about how it would affect me. \n\n\n\nFrom meeting to\nmeeting, I barely remembered the ones I saw from the previous month. A handful\nof newbies came and went from time to time, but no one noticed when they didn’t\nshow up again. We were keenly aware that only a handful would make it out alive\nand were relieved when we were still sitting in that imperfect circle of\nchairs. \n\n\n\nOne week several\nnewbies appeared at once. A Konstanz with a “Z” she said,\nthen a Bronwyn, and our hawk-nosed Katlyn paraded in wearing heels and heavy\nmakeup probably for the first time. The more flamboyant monikers revealed a\nchange in attitude among the community as if they were no longer ashamed of\nbeing born odd. They reinvented themselves like children playing in a\nmake-believe world pretending to be something different than they were born—not\nquite a white knight, a soldier, or cowboy but almost always a damsel in\ndistress. \n\n\n\nI didn’t\nknow why anyone would want to be a victim but some of the newbies tended to\nrevel in it like it was their destiny. They came in to challenge the\ngatekeepers, who tried without success to screen them out. The clinic staff\nfound the majority of the support group were these new gender-warriors, many\nalso in need of services. They did not want to change their sex. They\ndisappeared at an alarming rate when they or Canon Jones realized the program\nwas not designed to accommodate them.\n\n\n\nWe turned off\nreality. When someone was missing at the next meeting, we did not ask\nquestions. They could be dead or just decided to revert back to the real world\nand hang up their heels for a while. We never knew. We’d see a newbie sitting\nin a chair where the recently deceased should be and we’d go on acting as\nthough they showed up again—transformed.\n\n\n\nI attended\nseveral meetings, twice a month, while still living at home in Vermont. But as\nthe hormonal therapy progressed, and I began to look and feel differently, I\nknew I had to leave the safety of my home and family if I was to ever become\nthe person, I knew I was meant to be.   \n\n#\n\n\n\n\nShare this:ShareTweetEmailPrintShare on TumblrLike this:Like Loading...\t\n\n\t\n\t\tPosted byFyrecurlSeptember 29, 2019October 4, 2019Posted inExcerpt, Feminist, Gender issues, LGBTQ, Memoir, non-fiction, Trans women, Women and SocietyTags:biography, cultural, diversity, DSM-V, gender dysphoria, Indy writer, Psychology, She-Male, TranssexualLeave a comment on Excerpt From:  The XX Club – a memoir\t\n \n \n\t\n\t\tThe XX Club – a memoir\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\tBy: Michelle Berthiaume\n       *** Soon to be released  ***\nThe 1990s was a dangerous time to go against their Makers design …\n\nShare this:ShareTweetEmailPrintShare on TumblrLike this:Like Loading...\t\n\n\t\n\t\tPosted byFyrecurlSeptember 24, 2019Posted inExcerpt, Gender issues, LGBTQ, Memoir, non-fiction, Sex, Society, Trans women, Women and Society, WritingTags:biography, Books, creative writing, cultural, LGBTQ, novel, trannssexualLeave a comment on The XX Club – a memoir\t\n \n \n\t\n\t\tThe Poet\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\tSpeak to me dear poet,\nlet me hear your gentle voice before the dawn and regret seeps in through the tattered curtains of my life.\nLet your words pour through my weary bones, refresh my soul with your divine,\nI am, for these fine moments before the light, your instrument,\nplay hard until comes the day with all its revelry and spite.\nLeave your mark upon me so all will know that I was yours and you were mine this last beloved night.\nShare this:ShareTweetEmailPrintShare on TumblrLike this:Like Loading...\t\n\n\t\n\t\tPosted byFyrecurlFebruary 3, 2019Posted inDepression, Love, Poetry, Romance, WritingTags:aging, art, creative writing, death, Free Verse, heartbreak, Love, Poetry, women, WritingLeave a comment on The Poet\t\n \n \n\t\n\t\tThe Poet\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\nSpeak to me dear poet,\nlet me hear your gentle voice before the dawn and regret seeps in through the tattered curtains of my life.\nLet your words pour through my weary bones, refresh my soul with your divine,\nI am, for these fine moments before the light, your instrument,\nplay hard until comes the day with all its revelry and spite.\nLeave your mark upon me so all will know that I was yours and you were mine this last beloved night.\nShare this:ShareTweetEmailPrintShare on TumblrLike this:Like Loading...\t\n\n\t\n\t\tPosted byFyrecurlJanuary 31, 2019July 3, 2019Posted inWomen and SocietyLeave a comment on The Poet\t\n \n \n\t\n\t\tTHE SEVENTH DAUGHTER\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\nA Daughter is a rose without thorns . . . – Emily Michelle McNamee\n\n\n\n___________\n\n\n\nWhen he died, Da was only forty-five. They lied to Ma and said he fell off his horse. I knew it was not the fall that killed him. Not that a games-keeper for the Kings’ estate in County Cork could not fall off his horse. I’d seen Da do it after a visit to Killian’s Pub but I’d seen the leaves on the morn of his death and knew. The lord of the manor had come all the way from England for the annual hunt. He come into the kitchen and had me do his reading when Da was outside hitching up the wagon. I curtsied and told him: “Nah, Sir, I am forbade to read the leaves. If Father McGinnis finds out, there’d be the devil to pay.” Lord Kensington laughed.\n\n\n\n“It’s not for real, Lass. It’s for entertainment.” Although I was barely eleven, my skills with alchemy and other gifts were legendary among the Baile. “Come now. Let’s see what ya can do. You are the seventh daughter of the seventh daughter, are you not?”\n\n\n\nI nodded and fetched the pot from the stove and prepared his cup. I no sooner poured the water over the dried leaves and the chill fell upon me. I shuddered. He laughed and helped me steady the pot back onto the stove. His hands stayed on my shoulders and slid down to cover my hands. They were soft for a man. Not a callous or scar on them. he twirled me around as if to study me. Then of a sudden he let go and sat back down. His eyes bade me to go on. \n\n\n\nWhen he was through his breakfast including the tea I poured him he put his cup on the table, sat back and bade me to sit upon his lap. My sisters stood in the corner staring at their shoes. As lord of the manor our whole family were his servants. None dare deny his command. I stared into the bottom of the empty cup staring at the pattern the leaves had formed. when they all had seemed to settle into place, it presented itself in Olde English, a language of his ancestors that I was least familiar. As a daughter of the head games-keeper, I had learned all manner of things beyond my station to assist the ladies of the men who came to the manor for the hunt. From the various guests I learned French, Welch, Gaelic, and some Olde English. It was the hardest to learn, taught me by the Lord’s spinster sister, Cecile, who used to accompany him in the years when she could ride. \n\n\n\n“Well, girl, hurry up. I don’t have all day. We got game to catch.” My sisters snickered nervously from the corner by the stove and his man, Charles, who tended to his personal needs, stood somberly to one side holding his boots. \n\n\n\n“It’s hard, Sir. It’s in a difficult tongue. I have to wait for the images to form in me brain. You have a different linage. I—” I stopped suddenly when it came to me as if spoken into my ear by some faerie passing through. “A man will die on the hunt this day,” I cried in a voice much too old for me and that vibrated as if more than one person was speaking from far away. I pulled away from his grasp. Startled by my outburst, he let go of me and I landed on the floor on the pads of my feet. He held the table to steady himself as he stood. Perhaps he thought I meant him. \n\n\n\n“Nonsense, girl.” He shouted. “You disappoint me.” I saw his blue eyes widen before he ran out the back door in his stocking feet with Charles chasing after him. I ran out the front where I knew Da was waiting with the wagon. It was his job to show the Lord and his party where the beasts would be hiding and carry back the prizes of the day in his wagon. \n\n\n\n“Da, don’t go!” I screamed. Dark clouds were already forming on the horizon above the gables. \n\n\n\n“Katie, calm down. We’ll be back ‘afore the sun falls. Tell your mother to prepare stock for venison.” He was laughing at me. I nearly took a fall. “It’s a fine day. Cernunnos smiles upon the McNamee. A big white on the mountain goin’ a fall. I know—”\n\n\n\n“The stag is in the heather, not on the hill and ’tis an omen, Da.” I finish for him. It got his attention. I’d broke my promise. He knew. His face turned ashen then red. \n\n\n\n“Katie, go back inside. I’ll deal with ya when I return.”\n\n\n\n“No, don’t go.”  \n\n\n\n“Katie!” He raised the whip in his hand then clutched his chest with the other. I ran back inside to tell Ma. But it was too late. Pa was already chasing his big white stag in the heather.\n\n\n\nIt was dusk when the horn sounded and the hunt was over. I sat stone still on the swing on the back porch. I hovered, bare feet dangling over the edge, looking out over the heather, a Norse wind teasing the ends of my skirts then it lifted me. I am on the wagon beside my Da. We sit in silence looking down across the spotted back of Martha, feeling the warmth of the late afternoon sun on our faces as she trots down the lane toward home. He looks happy to see me. All my witchery forgotten. He looks to the sea toward Neamh. His old eyes smiling. He squeezes me hand and together we begin: “And I’d give the world if she could sing, that song to me this day.” \n\n\n\n \nShare this:ShareTweetEmailPrintShare on TumblrLike this:Like Loading...\t\n\n\t\n\t\tPosted byFyrecurlDecember 14, 2018January 11, 2020Posted inFamily, Fiction, Memoir, Women and Society, WritingTags:art, Books, creative writing, daughters, flash fiction; short story;, Inspiration, literature, womenLeave a comment on THE SEVENTH DAUGHTER\t\n \n \n\t\n\t\tJen Rose\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\tHer name is Jen Rose. She is my daughter and I have learned a lot from her on how to be an  empowered woman in an ever-changing world. Even as a child her inner strength and compassion radiated to everyone around her. Somehow she managed to rise up from being a petite introverted girl to become the hero others, boys and girls alike, admired and strove to emulate. Granted, her ubringing was not conventional. The Airforce moved us around the country when she was small but prior to starting school we settled down in a small town in Central Vermont where they had a progressive school system. She began playing sports,  particularly soccer, since she was first able to walk. I coached her and her younger sister, Jaq, and dozens of other children in a youth sports program designed to introduce, the then foreign sport, to a city that prided itself on it’s hockey, football and baseball championship teams. By the time Jen Rose was in seventh grade she was playing softball, basketball, bowling, track and soccer nearly year round along with her baby sister and began to gain regional attention. When she broke her leg in a soccer match shortly before basketball season she asked the doctor for a walking cast so she could keep active. I don’t think the doctor anticipated she would be clip-clipping up and down a court in front of cheering crowds to help her team to victory. A week after the cast came off she called me on the telephone and told me had assembled the first ever girls’s team to compete in a summer soccer league and then informed me that I was the coach. That summer both Jaq and Jen Rose were scouted and picked up by an international girls youth soccer team from the state’s largest city. We traveled to Canada where both Jen Rose and Jaq distinguished themselves as two of the state’s premiere players to contend with. Jen at midfield and Jaq, who had shot up to be the tallest girl in her class, as goalie. The area newspapers adored Jen Rose and covered her extensively as she progressed. She was hailed as the best female athlete to hit Central Vermont and filled a scrap book of clippings more than an inch thick. Despite all of the adoration she never let it go to head and always praised the other players on her teams. She managed to keep up her grades to remain in the top third academically in her class and in her senior year she wrote, directed, acted and choreographed the Senior school production of Let’s Put on a Play with her sister, Jaq,  in the lead role. That same year she and her sisters bowling team won the state finals. Immediately after the last ball rolled down the lane, we drove 2 hours to Smith College in Massachusetts so that she could compete in the regional track meet. She took third in the 440 meter race.  The day that Coach Ventriglia called to inform her that she had a position on the Lady Knights, West Points’ prestigious women’s soccer team, Jen Rose, and her little sister, Jaq, played in a match that would culminate their illustrious athletic careers at Spalding Regional High school. With several broken meta tarsals in both feet, in double over time and with one player down, Jen  came out of sweeper position to rush down the field to score the winning goal against a team that hadn’t lost a game in three consequetive seasons. The papers credited the win to her and “Jen’s little sister”. Jaq earned the title of “spider woman” for the countless spectacular saves in net. That Spring, Jaq, requested she play on a separate softball team citing she as tired of being referred to as: Jen’s Little sister.  As fate would have it the two teams were pitted against each other in the softball state finals with the winner representing Vermont in the regional at Amherst. Jen’s team went to the regional tournament. She weathered her Parents divorce the breakup of her family and the trials and tribulations of being one of the few female cadets at USMA at West Point during a difficult period and graduated in 1997. She went onto play soccer for the Army winning a gold medal before she hung up her cleats. She served along side her little sister, in many overseas campaigns including Bosnia, Kuwait,  and took over a command in Baghdad before leaving the service to raise her own family.  Although, her athletic and military careers were impressive and as her parent made me proud of her accomplishments. The one thing that will for her stand out in my mind was the time we took her and some of her friends to Ben \u0026 Jerry’s for ice cream. When we were ordering at the counter we discovered she was missing. We frantically ran outside and spotted her across the street assisting an elderly man with his groceries. I am so very proud and grateful to God, she is my daughter. She now has two daughters of her own she raises with her military husband. She put away her scrap book, medals and trophys. Keeping them out of sight, in some drawer of an old dresser and on a shelf collecting dust in the back of her closet, where they can do no harm. She is trying not to influence her daughters or make them feel they must compete or follow in her wake. When I tell them their mother was a superstar they look at me and smile as though I’ve told them some fairy tale. To them, she is a Wonder Woman because she’s: Mom. \nShare this:ShareTweetEmailPrintShare on TumblrLike this:Like Loading...\t\n\n\t\n\t\tPosted byFyrecurlDecember 14, 2018December 14, 2018Posted inExcerpt, Family, feminism, Gender issues, kids, Memoir, Mothers, Parenting, Society, Women and SocietyTags:daughters, Family, ParentsLeave a comment on Jen Rose\t\n \n \n\t\n\t\tThe View\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\nA wealthy merchant bought land in a village so he could build a house overlooking a great mountain. He hired a magic elf to construct his home and gave him the plans. When it was finished the man noticed the elf had followed his plans perfectly except there were only two windows both placed side by side facing the mountain. The man confronted the elf and demanded an explanation. “Why did you only put in two windows when I told you I wanted to see the world in all its grandeur!” The elf said: “I followed your instructions. One window is when you wish to see the world as it is. The other is for those days you wake up and see the world as you wish it to be.” Still furious when the elf left he decided to see which window gave him the best view. There were no markings to indicate which was the wishing view. They looked identical and when he looked out he saw the same view of the mountain.\n\n\n\nA week later he saw the elf again on the street and the elf asked him how he liked his view.\n\n\n\nThe man retorted: “Each morning I wake up and go to the window on the left and look out and then the one on the right and see the same mountain. There is no difference.”\n\n\n\n“You’re not wishing hard enough. Go home and give it another try. This time think about the way you would like it to look before openning the curtains,” the elf said then disappeared into the crowded market.\n\n\n\nSo the man went home and this time he thought about the wild flowers he used to see growing on the side of the mountain when he was a boy but when he opened his eyes he saw only the same stark view of the mountain from both windows. Still angry with the elf he went back to the town and when he couldn’t find him he bought a ton of wildflower seeds from a farmer and hired workers to plant them on the side of the mountain.\n\n\n\nIn the Spring he marveled at the sight of the mountain with its splendid colors from all of the wildflowers he had planted but when he looked out of the window on the right the view was the same.\n\n\n\nWhen the man saw the elf on the street that morning he confronted him. “Elf, I did as you instructed but the views from each window are the same.”\n\n\n\n“Tell me, my friend, is the view the same as when I constructed your house?”\n\n\n\nThe wealthy man smiled.\nShare this:ShareTweetEmailPrintShare on TumblrLike this:Like Loading...\t\n\n\t\n\t\tPosted byFyrecurlDecember 14, 2018July 3, 2019Posted inFiction, Prose, Women and Society, WritingTags:flash fiction, perspective, StoryLeave a comment on The View\t\n \n \n\t\n\t\tTranscendence\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\nEach and every night, without fail\nI breach the inky darkness lunging dripping wet,\nI fall beneath the fragile surface of a dream, transcending space and time, without regret,\nSearching and soaring mile after scathing mile, beneath a scarlet moon,\n\n\n\nFalling and melding into the endless void\n\n\n\nto find you …\n\n\n\n\nShare this:ShareTweetEmailPrintShare on TumblrLike this:Like Loading...\t\n\n\t\n\t\tPosted byFyrecurlOctober 30, 2018July 3, 2019Posted inExcerpt, Love, Poetry, Romance, Women and Society, WritingTags:Free Verse, InspirationLeave a comment on Transcendence\t\n \n \n\t\n\t\tCandy Surprise\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\tMOM: Here you can have these chocolate covered nuts if you like.\nMe: “What are they?” I ask, as she pours me a handful.\nMom: IT’S some kind of gormet candy I picked up at the store. supposed to be chocolate covered nuts but taste like coffee.\n\nMe: I thought you liked candy.

We all have them. Some more than others. Addiction, neglect, self-loathing, fears and maladies of all types. They creep into our lives when we least suspect, sometimes right after having a baby and no one fully understand why. Everyone deals with it differently. I use prayer, meditation and exercise to stimulate endorphins in the brain to feel better. Writing or some other form of artistic expression also helps particularly in those darker days with less light. We used to live with layers of generations in one home or close by and the frequent contact of our social circle often made one feel less alone. But alone is how you must face your problem in the final scheme of things bc even those you feel comfort and cherish advice from cannot live your life for you. You have to choose if you want to feel better. No one can do that for you. Find solace in knowing that you have already accomplished much more in your lifetime than many and have friends and family who love you dearly. Take that love and stop feeling you can’t give back a hundredfold of what they give you. A doctor once told me after my first suicide attempt at thirteen, to run and not stop until you can’t. As long as you can keep running, you’ll find something in life worth running to. GOOD luck. Feel better soon.\n\n\n\nAll my love and encouragement,\n\n\n\nFyrecurl\n\n\n\n\nShare this:ShareTweetEmailPrintShare on TumblrLike this:Like Loading...\t\n\n\t\n\t\tPosted byFyrecurlJuly 29, 2018July 3, 2019Posted inWomen and SocietyLeave a comment on When Darkness Comes …\t\n",

We’re entirely a cyber security testing and training company, which means that there is no implicit vendor bias and our testing is always impartial and free of any conflicts of interest. \n \n \n \nAn engagement typically consists of scope confirmation, a kickoff meeting, weekly or more frequent status updates, knowledge transfer, report delivery, an optional re-testing period and a final outbrief.  We encourage client staff to observe and monitor the testing process to learn from our experience, approach and methodology. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n FYRM Associates also performs “Root Cause” analysis to determine how the vulnerability was introduced in the environment.

  "inline_text": "Fyrkuna Metalworks \n Liberia \n Fyrkuna metalworks is a Liberian-owned company with a german manager, Manfred Zbrzezny. Working since 2007 we specialize in weapon conversion, “Arms into art ” Furthermore we execute metal construction and design works in steel.Broom Camp, Brewerville, Montserrado County, Liberia \n On major projects, we employed up to 12 welders, but since one of the difficulties encountered was the lack of technical skill in local welders we redimensioned our set up. Our hope is to conduct proper and serious training for our workers and future apprentices. \n To maintain our capacity in professional welding we are able to contract certified African welders. \n Training workshops for the producers of improved cooking stoves ( red firepot)  have been conducted at our facility. \n  \n I work since 2007 on the weapon conversion project – arms into art. The weapon scrap is a left-over from the disarmament process. \n The first request was if I could create a banister with a marine design for a restaurant on the Saint Paul river, home to the local fishing club . Having completed this I designed furniture for the same place made from Rpg-launchers, AK 47 barrels, and wood. \n My next job was to create small objects such as candle stands, bookends, school bells, and bottle openers. \n In 2008 on request by Save the children- U.k. I developed a small tree for their fundraiser “Festival of Trees”, which was auctioned for 24.000 Pound Sterling entirely for the benefit of Liberian children. Children from 2 communities in Monrovia collaborated on this project with drawings and words on the importance of peace. These small messages on paper were placed into shell casings hanging on the tree as its fruits.The company that purchased it decided to sponsor a bigger tree for the people of Liberia. This peace tree is in place on Providence Island since 2011. \n I produce these objects together with the welders and trainees of Fyrkuna-metalworks.In the design, I try to create a contra point to the mean implications of weapons by shapes of nature and serenity. \n To transform arms into art illustrates the complex process in which a destructive device, which has been demobilized, becomes a creative part of the metal design.Working on weapon scrap in Liberia has its implications. For example, the peace tree is intended to be a reminder ” not to forget “ and to express our hope for a peaceful life in Liberia. It carries a message for the Liberian people, they can transform their past suffering into something positive. A prolonged civil war leaves wounds in both society and individuals and reconstruction is not only a material process but also somehow spiritual. \n A way of helping in this healing process is transforming arms into art. Furthermore it is a clear political statement. \n Looking at arms into art the majority of people remains thoughtfully silent, some feel uncomfortable and a few enthusiastic. A marine while observing a sculpture remarked ” You are making a long nose to all soldiers.” \n During the working process, the blacksmith can have his flight of thoughts related to what he is producing. On weapon, scrap is naturally the thought of what became of the perpetrators and the victims. This moment often leads me to leave the work for a while, but getting used to the material brought me to see it just as scrap. But the thought still occurs ” what became of…” .Someone is expressing himself by singing, someone is expressing himself by shooting.It is the duty of those that sing to stop the others from shooting.. \n Fyrkuna Metal Works – Liberia \n Fyrkuna Metal Works – Liberia \n  \n Fyrkuna Metalworks specializes in Weapon conversion “arms into art“.

I’m a pretty eclectic reader – mostly fantasy, sci-fi, young adult fiction, historical fiction, and general fiction, with an increasing smattering of non-fiction, but I’m willing to give most genres a try. \n This blog allows me to keep all of my book reviews and other reading-related information in one place.  Since the beginning of 2006, I have reviewed every new book I’ve read (plus a few that I’ve re-read).  I’m slowly transferring old reviews over here, but you can view them all at LibraryThing. \n I actually am usually a fairly competent speller, I swear. I’ve been using various permutations of “fyrefly” as an online handle ever since I was a teenager, when I decided that it would be cool and rebellious to spell “fire” with a Y.  The fact that I thought this counted as cool and rebellious should give you some indication of what I was like as a teenager. \n I’m attempting to only read the books I already own, or at least clear more from my TBR pile than I add to it. (And, for the most part, failing miserably at the attempt.) For the curious, you can see my TBR pile here or at LibraryThing, and mock my utter lack of progress on my monthly wrap-up posts. \n I’m always happy to consider review requests!  If you have a book you’d like me to read and review, please let me know… although please check out my full review policy first. \n All text and images on this blog are copyrighted material, and may not be reproduced elsewhere without express permission by their owners (which, in the case of the text of the reviews and non-book-cover images, is me). \n First-time comments are moderated, so if you don’t see your comment immediately, don’t panic.  On the other hand, abusive or spammy comments are Not Okay; if I get the feeling you’re trying to sell me or my readers something, I reserve the right to edit out the spammy parts or delete the comment outright. \n I’m on the audiobook group and I’m looking for 2 or 3 people who might be interested in reviewing Science Fiction/Fantasy audiobooks for the website, SF Site. I’m hesitant to open my request to the entire group, so am limiting my requests to those who have a history of listening, enjoy SF/F and can write. I review for SF Site (http://www.sfsite.com) and the editor asked if I could find some more reviewers for audiobooks.  You can go to my LibraryThing profile (audiobookdj) for more info about me. I really do need some good reviewers and I hope you’re interested. Drop me a line if you are at __________. I’ll be glad to send you additional information.\nThanks! — Susan \n You have an absolutely beautiful blog!  I love it’s look and feel and the Reading List page is excellent.  It’s inspiring me to create a list page of my own so people can easily find my reviews.  Hopefully soon I’ll get my website up and running.  I really want a unique place on the web like you have.  Just wonderful! \n Thanks!  The Reading List is actually a relic from my earliest days of maintaining a website.  I used to keep the reading list in hard form on the inside covers of my journal… and then I started reading more, and more, and the written list got out of control, and so I transferred it to the web.  After five years worth of recording my reading, it’s getting kind of unwieldy, but I can’t bring myself to change it. \n Hi Fyrefly, \n I found your blog through a link on Devourer of Books’ blog. I really enjoy your content and I wanted to introduce myself and my work to you. I am an online publicist. I work to connect online writers with review books. \n It’s super easy! Just go to my site (http://onlinepublicist.net), look at what I have available, and if any of the titles interest you for review on your blog, just send me a little note through the contact page. I will have a copy sent to you, then, once the book arrives, we can work out a review date that works for you! \n Feel free to do a google blog search of my name to see what other bloggers have said about me and my work. I hope to hear from you soon… \n All Best.\nLisa\n—\nLisa Roe\nOnline Publicist \n lroe@onlinepublicist.net\nhttp://onlinepublicist.net\n— \n Thanks for stopping by Passion for the Page, Fyrefly. You have a great blog here (I love your header!). Now I see why we are both drawn to that chemistry quote in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn — I’m a biochemist/geneticist turned childrens science writer ;o). I’ve added you to my Google Reader to better keep up with your haikus. What a great, direct review! Wish I could write that concisely! \n This is an enjoyable and inelligent blog. It’s going in my bookmarks. Thanks for the work. \n I like to misspell things (on purpose) too. Especially when it comes to coming up with character names for stories! \n This a great idea. I still keeps notes in a notebook. A decidedly low tech solution for a tech writer, but I digress. I enjoy your comments and my borrow your TBR acronym if you don’t mind. I am always referring to my “pile.” \n Thank you for this wonderful blog! Love the reviews, and for the books that I’ve already read, they are spot-on. Well done, and keep it up! \n Oh, and I have a really good book to recommend. It’s called ‘Grotesque’ by Natsuo Kirino (translated into English) which is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! In my head, anyway ;) \n Hi Fyrefly – My name is Michelle and I have created a brand new book blog called http://texasbooklover.blogspot.com/\nI have added your site to my fav blog list and would very much appreciate it if you would add my blog to the search engine. Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.\nThank you so much – Texas Book Lover \n Hi I just stopped by to read your review of 19th Wife. But I decided to become a follower. I enjoyed reading your blog.  I plan on stopping more often. My  blog is  http://susansliterarycafe.blogspot.com  Have a great day. \n Just wanted to say I really enjoy your site!  Thought I would introduce myself.  \n Best, \n Christine \n I am a graduate student in neuropsychology, and I absolutely love YA fiction and fantasy/sci-fi fiction, so my appetite has found a delightful home on your blog. Everyone always rags on me for loving “kids” books, yet being in a very advanced, scientific field – I think everyone has been misinformed of the value of children’s literature. :) \n Thank you for your blog! Now I know where to go next when I’m looking for my next literary fix :) Keep up the good work. \n Indeed. I love the blog. \n I enjoyed visiting your blog.Your vocab list is a great addition to a book blog! \n I just stumbled upon your blog. This is wonderful! I am currently reading Tooth and Claw by Jo Walton and look forward to spending more time on you blog. Thank you for you hard work and passion for reading! \n Ugh! Should always re read my posts … the “r” in your never seams to enter my typing. Why is that??? \n Hi! I’ve stumbled across your blog a couple of times and have my own book review blog as well. I have to admit, I’m not that good at reviewing books but I do love to read and thought I could do something with that. I was just wondering what it was like when you first started out. I’ve just received around 22 bot messages! Thanks and wonderful reviews! \n Hi I just stumbled across your blog and really like the layout of your site and diversity of your taste in books. \n  I have a book blog too but my WordPress one is fairly new so am grateful for any tips, for instance. If you don’t mind me asking… You say you are gradually transferring old reviews – do you backdate them, highlight them in some way as old reviews or just post them in amongst your current reading? I’m grappling with this dilemma at the moment and would love some other people’s perspectives. \n Heh, you’ve caught me out there.  I put that on my “About” page a few years ago when I underwent a spurt of adding old reviews, but I got back to the point where I had started writing them in my current format (summary/review/recommendation), and haven’t moved any of the earlier ones since. What I did at the time was just to backdate them to the day that I finished the book, and put them up that way.   \n If I were doing it now, I might put them in in between my regular posts. I actually do do this occasionally, when I re-read a book for which I never posted the original review, and call it a “Review Revisited”. I think posting old reviews (maybe with a “From the Archives” label) mixed in with current reads would be just fine… in fact, I’m going to keep that idea in mind for the times when I’m too busy to write a fresh review (which seem to be increasingly common nowadays!) \n Hi, thanks for your really helpful response. I think this is what I’m going to start doing with a few of my old reviews, a “one from the vault” type thing. It’ll be good to have those as content to post when I am reading a really long novel and there’s longer than usual between my current updates. Much obliged for your suggestion! \n I’ve nominated you for the Working to change the World award, congratulations! you can read more here..\nhttp://betweenthelinesbookblog.wordpress.com/2014/02/28/working-to-change-the-world-award/\nHave a lovely day! \n Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in: \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t( Log Out / \n\t\t\t\tChange )\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your Google account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t( Log Out / \n\t\t\t\tChange )\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your Twitter account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t( Log Out / \n\t\t\t\tChange )\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your Facebook account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t( Log Out / \n\t\t\t\tChange )\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n Connecting to %s \n  Notify me of new comments via email. \n  Notify me of new posts via email. \n  \n\n \n  \n This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

I’ve stumbled across your blog a couple of times and have my own book review blog as well. I have to admit, I’m not that good at reviewing books but I do love to read and thought I could do something with that. I was just wondering what it was like when you first started out. I’ve just received around 22 bot messages!

If you don’t mind me asking… You say you are gradually transferring old reviews – do you backdate them, highlight them in some way as old reviews or just post them in amongst your current reading? I’m grappling with this dilemma at the moment and would love some other people’s perspectives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReply\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFyrefly permalink*\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApril 11, 2013 11:19 am\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHeh, you’ve caught me out there.  I put that on my “About” page a few years ago when I underwent a spurt of adding old reviews, but I got back to the point where I had started writing them in my current format (summary/review/recommendation), and haven’t moved any of the earlier ones since. What I did at the time was just to backdate them to the day that I finished the book, and put them up that way.  \nIf I were doing it now, I might put them in in between my regular posts. I actually do do this occasionally, when I re-read a book for which I never posted the original review, and call it a “Review Revisited”. I think posting old reviews (maybe with a “From the Archives” label) mixed in with current reads would be just fine… in fact, I’m going to keep that idea in mind for the times when I’m too busy to write a fresh review (which seem to be increasingly common nowadays!)\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReply\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\troxploration permalink\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApril 11, 2013 4:27 pm\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHi, thanks for your really helpful response.

  "inline_text": "\n \n The Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor published the annual report on the situation with the respect of religious freedom in the FYR Macedonia in the course of 2006. \n There is an impression that the greater art of the report has been dedicated to the denial of religious freedom to the citizens, members of the Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric.  \n http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71394.htm \n FYR. Macedonia has religious prisoners. \n The report deals with the imprisonment of His Beatitude, the Archbishop of Ohrid and Metropolitan of Skopje, k. k. Jovan implying that with the decision of the Supreme Court from February 2006, his prison sentence was reduced “which led to his release from prison, after which there were no cases of religious or political prisoners in the country”. We remind you that the Archbishop k. k. Jovan, after two releasing verdicts, has once again been put in prison, and the Macedonian Orthodox Church has once again filed a complaint against the liberating verdict reached regarding a third charge raised against him. The indicated proverbial corruption of the Macedonian judiciary is not subject to comment in this observation . \n   \n http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71394.htm \n According to the newest report of the Venice Commission, yet there are disputable items in the draft law of religious communities, especially at the point – registering religious communities. This report will be a subject of the following text. \n The Government of the FYR Macedonia, which protects the monopoly of the Macedonian Orthodox Church, is sacrificing the European future of the citizens. Critics point out the Government is only declaratively ready for reforms, while practically the reforms in terms of religious freedoms are tending to be evaded. \n At the same time, with the critics, in terms violating religious freedoms in the FYR Macedonia by the International Community, the Fund “Archbishop Jovan” from the United States of America has issued its newest \n  \n  'Criminally responsible'  \n  Mr Boskovski, 46, was alleged to have effective command and control over the forces from his position as interior minister.   \n         \n  \n  \"Due to his failure to take necessary and reasonable measures to punish the perpetrators of the crimes committed in the village of Ljuboten, the prosecution will ask you to find Ljube Boskovski criminally responsible as a superior,\" prosecutor Dan Saxon said.  \n  Prosecutors say Mr Tarculovski, 32, ran a private security unit loyal to Mr Boskovski and led the attack on the village. \n  \n There is support for Mr Boskovski in FYR MacedoniaSite against the imprisonment of Arch Bishop Jovan \n \n\n\n\n        ▼ \n      \n\n\n\n2010\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n        ▼ \n      \n\n\n\nMarch\n\n(1)\n\nViolations of Human Rights of Macedonian Citizens ...\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n        ▼ \n      \n\n\n\nMarch\n\n(1)\n\nViolations of Human Rights of Macedonian Citizens ...\n\n \n Violations of Human Rights of Macedonian Citizens ... \n \n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\n2008\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\nMarch\n\n(1)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\nMarch\n\n(1)\n \n \n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\n2007\n\n(7)\n\n\n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\nJuly\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\nJune\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\nMay\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\nFebruary\n\n(1)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\nJuly\n\n(3)\n \n \n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\nJune\n\n(1)\n \n \n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\nMay\n\n(2)\n \n \n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\nFebruary\n\n(1)\n",

  "inline_text": "Strangely enough, the two words are not meant to be interchangeable.  True, sometimes sex can be fun…and sometimes it can be bloody horrible too.  But my real point is, that the word fun should not be directly correlated to sex. \n Now, any woman that has ventured into the world of online dating has encountered those men (they appear to be legion) who mean nothing but sex, when they type the word fun on their keyboard (there may be women who think the same way – thankfully I personally have been spared their acquaintance thus far). \n It is not always easy to pick out those who subscribe to this narrow definition.  Sometimes, they put it in their profiles, or in an initial email, which gives the recipient the painless option of immediately blocking the profile, and/or deleting the email.  Quite simple really. \n But then there are those who write quite innocuous profiles (sometimes quite interesting ones), and who write pleasant and polite initial emails.  You respond, exchange a few more emails, begin to think “hey, this sounds like an interesting person”. and you move into IM exchanges. \n Now many websites have their own IMs, which make it easy to eliminate someone who transgresses (without having to block them from your personal online communication tool of choice.  Most sites do not have web-cam options though.  So the first clue, is when a man (or woman) becomes very urgent in their desire to talk to you on Messenger, Yahoo, Skype, etc.   A red flag that, curiously enough, they share with scammers. \n Once they exchange ids with you, and open up a chat window in this new platform, the next question is “Can you turn on your web-cam?”.    If you – wisely – demur to comply, the chances are, after some token protest, that they will accept your choice, but still insist on opening up their web-cam. \n Now, some of them will initially appear clothed.  Or at least, the portion of them that you can see is clothed.  If they are bare-chested, unless they appear to be sitting on a beach, where the passerbys are all wearing beach-style clothing, it is best to assume the nudity is total. \n It doesn’t take them long to get down to business (strange how I always considered business and fun to be at different ends of the spectrum!), and they will either invite you to view them (au naturale), ask you if you want to play a little, or if you want to watch them play a little.  If you again demur, they will then trot out the magic phrase “Aw, it’s just having a bit of fun!”. \n Seriously?  Watching some guy you barely/don’t  know jerk off, is fun?  Since when? \n Some of them don’t even ask first, but instead suddenly redirect the direction of their webcam in the direction of their genitalia, where they are already “playing”.  Presumably, they think that under those circumstances, you will be so enthralled by the sight of their appendage, that you will become glued to the screen, and pant along with them.   \n EEEWWWW!!! \n To the men that engage in this behaviour, or even try to entice women to play along, I have to say…this is NOT fun.  What this is, is crass, crude, vulgar and quite often disgusting and totally abhorent.   While an existing couple, in a loving relationship may choose to use internet sex as a way to maintain their relationship if temporarily separated, when it is a virtual stranger, then it is no better than having a man come up to you in the street, and expose himself to you.   \n Yes, guys, you are that dirty old man, in a dirty raincoat, flashing himself to strangers, in order to satisfy a perverse craving.  There is nothing “fun” about what you are doing, at all.  Women are not thrilled or turned on, seeing your naked penis.  You think we’ve never seen one before?  You think we might actually be impressed?  We might laugh at you and your rabid self-delusion – which is about as much fun as we will get from this situation – but we are never, ever impressed. \n I want the men/boys/perverts who consider this behaviour “fun” to find a dictionary, and check on the definition of the word.  I then want them to think back to their childhood, to that point where someone must have explained to them, that when you do something that hurts/upsets/disgusts/repels another person, no matter how much enjoyment you may personally gain from engaging in these actions, what you are doing is not fun, and is not acceptable behaviour.  Guys, is that what really turns you on?  Disgusting and revolting another human being?  If so, then you need serious therapy. \n I want the word fun given back to people who actually know how to have fun.  I don’t want to have to cringe, every time I talk to a man online, and he asks me if I want to have fun – I want to genuinely believe he is talking about inviting me out on a fun date, or something equally innocuous.  I don’t want to dread being asked if I have a webcam…I want to know that when someone asks to talk on webcam it’s because they want to genuinely see me as a person (and possibly to check I’m not posting fake photos).  When a man asks me if I want to watch him play online, I want him to mean he is playing a musical instrument. \n Because, to me, none of these things are fun, or playing, or having a good time.  What they are, is a man who is virtually a stranger to me, engaging in seriously deviant behaviour, that would get him arrested if he did it in person.  Being separated by the internet does not give someone licence to be a sex offender. \n   \n We’ve all heard of friends with benefits.  There has even been a movie recently made on the topic, which, being a romantic comedy, romanticises the notion, and of course, implies that such a course is not doomed to disaster. \n The tv series, Boston Legal, also visited the subject with two of their longer-running characters.  Of course, the fact that the woman in question was a very assertive, strong woman, who controlled the connection (at one point, she had two such “friends” at the same time) and that the main friend was in love with her made the whole scenario rather untrue to life. \n I know people who have walked that path.  In most cases it has led to disaster.  Way too many women think that if they go along with it, eventually the man in question will be smitten by their charms and will lay his heart at their feet.  In a couple of cases, it has worked out ok, but only when both people seriously do not want any more than a purely sexual arrangement, and both have eventually gone their separate ways quite happily.  But I personally, don’t know anyone that started off with that arrangement, and ended up together happily ever after.  No doubt it has happened, somewhere, to someone…but I would be very surprised if anyone could prove it to be a statistical probability. \n So, what is friends with benefits?  It is theoretically, an arrangement where two single people agree to meet sexual needs with each other, without all the hassle of a commitment of any kind (including something as harmless as boyfriend/girlfriend).  In essence, there are no promises, no guarantees, and either party is free to walk at any time guilt-free.  It sounds very mature, practical and modern, doesn’t it? \n Personally, since it is called friends with benefits, my literal assumption would be that the two people concerned were aquaintances, with common bonds and ties of friendship, and some background of liking and respect for one another.  Under those circumstances, and with suitable levels of sexual attraction for one another, and a background of social interaction which might or might not lead to sex on any given occasion, I could almost see this as being an eminently practical solution for many singles. \n There is a problem though. \n Many, many people who announce they want friends with benefits publicly – i.e. dating sites – are men…mostly very young men.  But for those who actually spell it out, they are not looking for any kind of friendship, or bond or social interaction with the opposite gender.  They just want to have sex without any kind of connection at all.  Most of them don’t even want to go through the parade of some kind of dating situation first.  Essentially, they want to name a time, a place, have the woman show up, satisfy the man’s needs, and then she disappears.  Purely mechanical, without any socialisation aspect to it at all.  Another, less flattering, but undoubtedly more honest name for this arrangement is a booty call.  Of course, to put it in it’s plainest, most unflattering terms, what these men want is a prostitute…but they don’t want to pay for one.  They want sex without intimacy, without developing any kind of liking or interest in the other person beforehand.  It’s the sexual equivalent of fast food. \n Of course, some women are happy with this arrangement.  I haven’t personally met one yet, but I am sure they are out there.  Mind you, I am sure the real working girls must eye with disbelief, those who exchange sex for…..nothing.  I don’t know if they have a motto, but if they do, I am sure it is something like “If you’re going to get laid, then you might as well get paid!”. \n This is the point at which someone is going to accuse me of being overly moral, or prudish…or possibly immoral after making up that slogan. \n But seriously…isn’t it really kind of sad and pathetic when two human beings couple in a mechanical, animalistic way…without having any genuine liking or interest in the other person?  And if you are happy to walk away without a background glance afterwards,then don’t try and argue that there is genuine liking or interest.  All you really mean is the other person didn’t revolt you. \n Humans are naturally social animals.  There is the odd exception, but most hermits become that way after being revolted or horrified or disgusted by the other humans they interact with.  An emotionally healthy human being, with healthy contacts with other human beings does not become a hermit.  Some people don’t need a lot of interactions, as long as those they do have are of high quality.  But we all need some. \n Sexual pairings are one way to add to our level of social interaction.  Certainly the whole courtship dance, whether or not it is designed or destined to end in a permanent pairing, is quite an exciting social interaction.  The initial attraction, flirting, the build-up of sexual tension, the anticipation…all of these things add  value to our lives.   When we skip all of that, and cut straight to the mechanical aspect of sex, then we lose all that excitement…the whole adrenaline rush of courtship. \n This leads me to suspect that those who seek only a no-strings attached coupling (NSA sex) are unable to achieve intimacy.  I exempt those who are in a temporary state of damage; e.g. the person who is recently out of a bad relationship, for example.  But for someone who doesn’t have that excuse….someone who simply want to “f*ck and flee” on every occasion…there is something definitely wrong with them, because a healthy social animal doesn’t work that way. \n As I said, there seems to be a preponderance of them on online dating sites.  I suspect that what seems to be an excessive number may be in part due to them flooding any and all prospects with their enticing emails..”U r hott…want 2 hav sum fun?”.  But there are certainly far more of them then there should be. \n So, friends without benefits is, to my mind at least, a bad idea.  So, I would like to suggest an alternative…sex with benefits. \n It works this way..two people meet who are sexually attracted to one another.  Rather than running at one another like animals in rut, and then running away again after before there can possibly be any suggestion of any other kind of interaction, they take a whole new approach.  They both actually work at heightening the attraction.  They flirt, they do things like dancing (incredibly sexual activity), they learn how to seduce the other person’s mind (yes, seduction is actually very sexual…who’d have thought?), they create an environment where brushing the other person’s hand is enough to trigger that rush of excitement and thrills.  And then when the tension is at it’s height, then and only then take the steps to actually engage in the next level of intimacy…and do that in the expectation that sexual intimacy also takes time (more than one night please!) to build and heighten into something bigger and better. \n Ok, maybe this won’t result in a white wedding, house in the suburbs, and 2.4 kids.  I never said they would, and in fact those results actually have very little to do with emotional intimacy…in many cases, those things can directly destroy or more frequently lead to atrophy of that intimacy.  But maybe, if more people learnt how to focus on building that intimacy in the first place, then relationships would be better overall, and have a higher success rate. \n And if, to get back to my food metaphor, people ate a lot less fast food, and learnt how to cook their own gourmet meals in partnership with others…they have a far better chance of eating in style for life.  And if one cooking partnership falls apart after a while, then you are better situated to find a new cooking partner in future.  Less running from one fast food joint to another, and more long-term exploration and development of fine restaurants (if you are still hanging in with this metaphor, good for you!). \n Anyway I, and I am sure a lot of other people out there don’t want an endless chain of soulless sexual encounters.  We want sex…but with all the benefits that it can bring…social interaction, emotional satisfaction, and sometimes even, an actual relationship.  Because frankly, if we are going to treat sex like a business transaction…then we might as well be getting paid for it. \n I joined a new gym today.  For most of the twelve months, since relocating to attend university, I have worked out at home.  Functional, but not always that exciting.  I did try out the university gym for a couple of months, but since there was a definite his area/her area vibe going on (weight area/cardio area respectively), and since in any case there was only one set of hand weights under 10kg apiece, it didn’t maintain my attention for long. \n So…it’s been over twelve months since I have consistently worked out in a gym.  I picked this one for a couple of reasons.  Location first up – it’s located on the path between uni and home, so very hard to avoid.  Secondly, the hours.  It’s a 24 hour gym, which works right in with my study induced insomnia.  Thirdly, it’s brand-new.  This has multiple benefits.  One is that they were offering very tempting joining offers.  Two is that there will not be a core of long-term residents who consider they “own” the place.  Three is…chock full of brand new, state of the art equipment. \n By and large, I prefer free weights, primarily because you engage more muscles when using them.  Of course, machines that isolate muscles do have an important role to play, particularly for people with injuries, who wish to consider training without causing further damage to a specific area.  And of course, when you train regularly, using machines can help to break up routines, and eliminate monotony. \n So, I am intrigued by the range of new designs this gym holds.   Since I don’t work out of a gym, I haven’t really kept up with the latest and greatest designs in machines, and obviously, I am going to be broadening my knowledge base in that regard. \n So, the next few weeks are going to be  interesting, as I find my way about this place, and more importantly, work out a whole new routine…and hopefully find some interesting things to write about. \n First sports medicine class on taping techniques yesterday.  After a session on how to do it right, we were all armed with tape, and directed to team up with someone else.  Being lucky that way, I ended up with two somebody else’s, and since I had already been nominated to be the first victim…er, patient…this meant I had both ankles being taped at the same time.  Just as well I wore running pants to the class. \n The moment of entertainment for me, was when the assistant tutor came to check my two classmates’ technique.  She is twenty something, and currently on crutches as a result of ankle surgery.  Blithely she asks me what ankle injuries I have sustained in my life.  Just as blithely, I answered none.  She looked at me…hard.  “Never?” she asks? “Nope” I replied.  All around me are my fellow students, many of them considerably younger than me.  Having not much to do while my ankles were strapped up, I had been eavesdropping on conversations all around me.  The class was riddled with all these healthy young things, whose ankle joints appear to be on the point of needing replacement.  And here am I, well, not ancient, but not twenty-something either, freely jumping up and down to prove just how great my ankles are.  It was a happy moment. \n Just as well she didn’t ask me about my knees… \n Well, this is my first post in a while.  Blame it on life.  Prep classes before the uni semester started again, and of course, getting into the swing of the new semester.  Not to mention starting a new part-time job, and of course, getting the munchkin organised into various sporting activities.  It’s been hectic. \n However, I finally found myself with time today to take a breath, and actually logged in here to see what’s been happening (aka, has anyone continued to visit my blog while it’s been static?).  Which, I am happy to say has been happening, and has cheered me immensely, and given me the boot in the pants to get started again. \n My courses this semester include functional anatomy, and sports medicine, so I am sure they are going to jumpstart me in many new directions.  In addition, I continue to pursue the cause of clean and healthy food. \n So here’s crossing my fingers that I get the ball rolling smoothly again.  And start writing something of substance.  😀 \n Enter

sometimes it can be bloody horrible too.  But my real point is, that the word fun should not be directly correlated to sex.\nNow, any woman that has ventured into the world of online dating has encountered those men (they appear to be legion) who mean nothing but sex, when they type the word fun on their keyboard (there may be women who think the same way – thankfully I personally have been spared their acquaintance thus far).\nIt is not always easy to pick out those who subscribe to this narrow definition.  Sometimes, they put it in their profiles, or in an initial email, which gives the recipient the painless option of immediately blocking the profile, and/or deleting the email.  Quite simple really.\nBut then there are those who write quite innocuous profiles (sometimes quite interesting ones), and who write pleasant and polite initial emails.  You respond, exchange a few more emails, begin to think “hey, this sounds like an interesting person”. and you move into IM exchanges.\nNow many websites have their own IMs, which make it easy to eliminate someone who transgresses (without having to block them from your personal online communication tool of choice.  Most sites do not have web-cam options though.  So the first clue, is when a man (or woman) becomes very urgent in their desire to talk to you on Messenger, Yahoo, Skype, etc.   A red flag that, curiously enough, they share with scammers.\nOnce they exchange ids with you, and open up a chat window in this new platform, the next question is “Can you turn on your web-cam?”.    If you – wisely – demur to comply, the chances are, after some token protest, that they will accept your choice, but still insist on opening up their web-cam.\nNow, some of them will initially appear clothed.  Or at least, the portion of them that you can see is clothed.  If they are bare-chested, unless they appear to be sitting on a beach, where the passerbys are all wearing beach-style clothing, it is best to assume the nudity is total.\nIt doesn’t take them long to get down to business (strange how I always considered business and fun to be at different ends of the spectrum!), and they will either invite you to view them (au naturale), ask you if you want to play a little, or if you want to watch them play a little.  If you again demur, they will then trot out the magic phrase “Aw, it’s just having a bit of fun!”.\nSeriously?  Watching some guy you barely/don’t  know jerk off, is fun?  Since when?\nSome of them don’t even ask first, but instead suddenly redirect the direction of their webcam in the direction of their genitalia, where they are already “playing”.  Presumably, they think that under those circumstances, you will be so enthralled by the sight of their appendage, that you will become glued to the screen, and pant along with them.  \nEEEWWWW!!!\nTo the men that engage in this behaviour, or even try to entice women to play along, I have to say…this is NOT fun.  What this is, is crass, crude, vulgar and quite often disgusting and totally abhorent.   While an existing couple, in a loving relationship may choose to use internet sex as a way to maintain their relationship if temporarily separated, when it is a virtual stranger, then it is no better than having a man come up to you in the street, and expose himself to you.  \nYes, guys, you are that dirty old man, in a dirty raincoat, flashing himself to strangers, in order to satisfy a perverse craving.  There is nothing “fun” about what you are doing, at all.  Women are not thrilled or turned on, seeing your naked penis.  You think we’ve never seen one before?  You think we might actually be impressed?  We might laugh at you and your rabid self-delusion – which is about as much fun as we will get from this situation – but we are never, ever impressed.\nI want the men/boys/perverts who consider this behaviour “fun” to find a dictionary, and check on the definition of the word.  I then want them to think back to their childhood, to that point where someone must have explained to them, that when you do something that hurts/upsets/disgusts/repels another person, no matter how much enjoyment you may personally gain from engaging in these actions, what you are doing is not fun, and is not acceptable behaviour.  Guys, is that what really turns you on?  Disgusting and revolting another human being?  If so, then you need serious therapy.\nI want the word fun given back to people who actually know how to have fun.  I don’t want to have to cringe, every time I talk to a man online, and he asks me if I want to have fun – I want to genuinely believe he is talking about inviting me out on a fun date, or something equally innocuous.  I don’t want to dread being asked if I have a webcam…I want to know that when someone asks to talk on webcam it’s because they want to genuinely see me as a person (and possibly to check I’m not posting fake photos).  When a man asks me if I want to watch him play online, I want him to mean he is playing a musical instrument.\nBecause, to me, none of these things are fun, or playing, or having a good time.  What they are, is a man who is virtually a stranger to me, engaging in seriously deviant behaviour, that would get him arrested if he did it in person.  Being separated by the internet does not give someone licence to be a sex offender.\n \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t__ATA.cmd.push(function() {\n\t\t\t\t\t__ATA.initDynamicSlot({\n\t\t\t\t\t\tid: 'atatags-26942-60a78fd2ecd97',\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlocation:

of friends with benefits.  There has even been a movie recently made on the topic, which, being a romantic comedy, romanticises the notion, and of course, implies that such a course is not doomed to disaster.\nThe tv series, Boston Legal, also visited the subject with two of their longer-running characters.  Of course, the fact that the woman in question was a very assertive, strong woman, who controlled the connection (at one point, she had two such “friends” at the same time) and that the main friend was in love with her made the whole scenario rather untrue to life.\nI know people who have walked that path.  In most cases it has led to disaster.  Way too many women think that if they go along with it, eventually the man in question will be smitten by their charms and will lay his heart at their feet.  In a couple of cases, it has worked out ok, but only when both people seriously do not want any more than a purely sexual arrangement, and both have eventually gone their separate ways quite happily.  But I personally, don’t know anyone that started off with that arrangement, and ended up together happily ever after.  No doubt it has happened, somewhere, to someone…but I would be very surprised if anyone could prove it to be a statistical probability.\nSo, what is friends with benefits?  It is theoretically, an arrangement where two single people agree to meet sexual needs with each other, without all the hassle of a commitment of any kind (including something as harmless as boyfriend/girlfriend).  In essence, there are no promises, no guarantees, and either party is free to walk at any time guilt-free.  It sounds very mature, practical and modern, doesn’t it?\nPersonally, since it is called friends with benefits, my literal assumption would be that the two people concerned were aquaintances, with common bonds and ties of friendship, and some background of liking and respect for one another.  Under those circumstances, and with suitable levels of sexual attraction for one another, and a background of social interaction which might or might not lead to sex on any given occasion, I could almost see this as being an eminently practical solution for many singles.\nThere is a problem though.\nMany, many people who announce they want friends with benefits publicly – i.e. dating sites – are men…mostly very young men.  But for those who actually spell it out, they are not looking for any kind of friendship, or bond or social interaction with the opposite gender.  They just want to have sex without any kind of connection at all.  Most of them don’t even want to go through the parade of some kind of dating situation first.  Essentially, they want to name a time, a place, have the woman show up, satisfy the man’s needs, and then she disappears.  Purely mechanical, without any socialisation aspect to it at all.  Another, less flattering, but undoubtedly more honest name for this arrangement is a booty call.  Of course, to put it in it’s plainest, most unflattering terms, what these men want is a prostitute…but they don’t want to pay for one.  They want sex without intimacy, without developing any kind of liking or interest in the other person beforehand.  It’s the sexual equivalent of fast food.\nOf course, some women are happy with this arrangement.  I haven’t personally met one yet, but I am sure they are out there.  Mind you, I am sure the real working girls must eye with disbelief, those who exchange sex for…..nothing.  I don’t know if they have a motto, but if they do, I am sure it is something like “If you’re going to get laid, then you might as well get paid!”.\nThis is the point at which someone is going to accuse me of being overly moral, or prudish…or possibly immoral after making up that slogan.\nBut seriously…isn’t it really kind of sad and pathetic when two human beings couple in a mechanical, animalistic way…without having any genuine liking or interest in the other person?  And if you are happy to walk away without a background glance afterwards,then don’t try and argue that there is genuine liking or interest.  All you really mean is the other person didn’t revolt you.\nHumans are naturally social animals.  There is the odd exception, but most hermits become that way after being revolted or horrified or disgusted by the other humans they interact with.  An emotionally healthy human being, with healthy contacts with other human beings does not become a hermit.  Some people don’t need a lot of interactions, as long as those they do have are of high quality.  But we all need some.\nSexual pairings are one way to add to our level of social interaction.  Certainly the whole courtship dance, whether or not it is designed or destined to end in a permanent pairing, is quite an exciting social interaction.  The initial attraction, flirting, the build-up of sexual tension, the anticipation…all of these things add  value to our lives.   When we skip all of that, and cut straight to the mechanical aspect of sex, then we lose all that excitement…the whole adrenaline rush of courtship.\nThis leads me to suspect that those who seek only a no-strings attached coupling (NSA sex) are unable to achieve intimacy.  I exempt those who are in a temporary state of damage; e.g. the person who is recently out of a bad relationship, for example.  But for someone who doesn’t have that excuse….someone who simply want to “f*ck and flee” on every occasion…there is something definitely wrong with them, because a healthy social animal doesn’t work that way.\nAs I said, there seems to be a preponderance of them on online dating sites.  I suspect that what seems to be an excessive number may be in part due to them flooding any and all prospects with their enticing emails..”U r hott…want 2 hav sum fun?”.  But there are certainly far more of them then there should be.\nSo, friends without benefits is, to my mind at least, a bad idea.  So, I would like to suggest an alternative…sex with benefits.\nIt works this way..two people meet who are sexually attracted to one another.  Rather than running at one another like animals in rut, and then running away again after before there can possibly be any suggestion of any other kind of interaction, they take a whole new approach.  They both actually work at heightening the attraction.  They flirt, they do things like dancing (incredibly sexual activity), they learn how to seduce the other person’s mind (yes, seduction is actually very sexual…who’d have thought?), they create an environment where brushing the other person’s hand is enough to trigger that rush of excitement and thrills.  And then when the tension is at it’s height, then and only then take the steps to actually engage in the next level of intimacy…and do that in the expectation that sexual intimacy also takes time (more than one night please!) to build and heighten into something bigger and better.\nOk, maybe this won’t result in a white wedding, house in the suburbs, and 2.4 kids.  I never said they would, and in fact those results actually have very little to do with emotional intimacy…in many cases, those things can directly destroy or more frequently lead to atrophy of that intimacy.  But maybe, if more people learnt how to focus on building that intimacy in the first place, then relationships would be better overall, and have a higher success rate.\nAnd if, to get back to my food metaphor, people ate a lot less fast food, and learnt how to cook their own gourmet meals in partnership with others…they have a far better chance of eating in style for life.  And if one cooking partnership falls apart after a while, then you are better situated to find a new cooking partner in future.  Less running from one fast food joint to another, and more long-term exploration and development of fine restaurants (if you are still hanging in with this metaphor, good for you!).\nAnyway I, and I am sure a lot of other people out there don’t want an endless chain of soulless sexual encounters.  We want sex…but with all the benefits that it can bring…social interaction, emotional satisfaction, and sometimes even, an actual relationship.  Because frankly, if we are going to treat sex like a business transaction…then we might as well be getting paid for it.\n\n        \n            __ATA.cmd.push(function() {\n

attend university, I have worked out at home.  Functional, but not always that exciting.  I did try out the university gym for a couple of months, but since there was a definite his area/her area vibe going on (weight area/cardio area respectively), and since in any case there was only one set of hand weights under 10kg apiece, it didn’t maintain my attention for long.\nSo…it’s been over twelve months since I have consistently worked out in a gym.  I picked this one for a couple of reasons.  Location first up – it’s located on the path between uni and home, so very hard to avoid.  Secondly, the hours.  It’s a 24 hour gym, which works right in with my study induced insomnia.  Thirdly, it’s brand-new.  This has multiple benefits.  One is that they were offering very tempting joining offers.  Two is that there will not be a core of long-term residents who consider they “own” the place.  Three is…chock full of brand new, state of the art equipment.\nBy and large, I prefer free weights, primarily because you engage more muscles when using them.  Of course, machines that isolate muscles do have an important role to play, particularly for people with injuries, who wish to consider training without causing further damage to a specific area.  And of course, when you train regularly, using machines can help to break up routines, and eliminate monotony.\nSo, I am intrigued by the range of new designs this gym holds.   Since I don’t work out of a gym, I haven’t really kept up with the latest and greatest designs in machines, and obviously, I am going to be broadening my knowledge base in that regard.\nSo, the next few weeks are going to be  interesting, as I find my way about this place, and more importantly, work out a whole new routine…and hopefully find some interesting things to write about.\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tPosted in Exercise \u0026 Fitness\t\t | \n\t\tTagged exercise, fitness, health, personal trainers, personal training, postaday2011 | \t\tLeave a

session on how to do it right, we were all armed with tape, and directed to team up with someone else.  Being lucky that way, I ended up with two somebody else’s, and since I had already been nominated to be the first victim…er, patient…this meant I had both ankles being taped at the same time.  Just as well I wore running pants to the class.\nThe moment of entertainment for me, was when the assistant tutor came to check my two classmates’ technique.  She is twenty something, and currently on crutches as a result of ankle surgery.  Blithely she asks me what ankle injuries I have sustained in my life.  Just as blithely, I answered none.  She looked at me…hard.  “Never?” she asks? “Nope” I replied.  All around me are my fellow students, many of them considerably younger than me.  Having not much to do while my ankles were strapped up, I had been eavesdropping on conversations all around me.  The class was riddled with all these healthy young things, whose ankle joints appear to be on the point of needing replacement.  And here am I, well, not ancient, but not twenty-something either, freely jumping up and down to prove just how great my ankles are.  It was a happy moment.\nJust as well she didn’t ask me about my knees…\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tPosted in Exercise \u0026 Fitness\t\t | \n\t\tTagged exercise, fitness, health, joint strapping, joint taping, lifestyle,

in a while.  Blame it on life.  Prep classes before the uni semester started again, and of course, getting into the swing of the new semester.  Not to mention starting a new part-time job, and of course, getting the munchkin organised into various sporting activities.  It’s been hectic.\nHowever, I finally found myself with time today to take a breath, and actually logged in here to see what’s been happening (aka, has anyone continued to visit my blog while it’s been static?).  Which, I am happy to say has been happening, and has cheered me immensely, and given me the boot in the pants to get started again.\nMy courses this semester include functional anatomy, and sports medicine, so I am sure they are going to jumpstart me in many new directions.  In addition, I continue to pursue the cause of clean and healthy food.\nSo here’s crossing my fingers that I get the ball rolling smoothly again.  And start writing something of substance.  😀\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tPosted in

  "inline_text": "\n \n The best way to use SQLite is to embed it in the game using the recommended amalgamation source code available on sqlite.org, but it is also available as a library for Windows (DLL) or Linux (shared-library .so ) . \n From a licensing point of view, using SQLite in any commercial game is also VERY safe since SQLite’s source has been released into the public domain. \n The following steps should allow C++ programmers to embed SQLite into their games. \n  \n Step 1 \n Go to http://www.sqlite.org and click on Download and grab  a file named sqlite-amalgamation-X_X_X.zip where the X’s are replaced by the appropriate version number. In my case I downloaded sqlite-amalgamation-3_7_0.zip (Windows) or sqlite-amalgamation-3.7.0.tar.gz (Linux) \n  \n  \n Step 2Extract the downloaded file and add the sqlite3.h and sqlite3.c files to the project. The size of the sqlite3.c file should be really big, around 3.96MB. \n Step 3Compile sqlite3.c in order to create a object file for it. The object file should be around 1.09MB. \n Step 4Include the sqlite3.h file in the game’s c++ files. For demonstration purposes I created a main.cpp file that looks as follows: \n #include \u003cstdio.h\u003e#include \u003ccstdlib\u003e#include \"sqlite3/sqlite3.h\"#include \u003cstring\u003eusing namespace std;int main(void){sqlite3 *db;char *zErrMsg = 0;int rc;string q = \"\";string dbName = \"game.dat\";//Attempt to open database. If it does not exist create it.rc = sqlite3_open(dbName.c_str(), \u0026db);if( rc ){fprintf(stderr, \"Can't open database: %s\\n\", sqlite3_errmsg(db));sqlite3_close(db);exit(1);}//Set query to executeq = \"\";sqlite3_close(db); //Always close db when done with itreturn 0;} \n Compile and run. There should now be a file called game.dat in the debug directory since SQLite will create the database file by default if it is not found. \n Step 5Since it is now possible to create a database it is time to create some tables. For demonstration purposes I created 2 tables. t_type and t_assets. \n  \n  \n  \n The Types table will simply contain information about various types of assets. The table will consist of an id for identification purposes, a parent id in order to be able to create a tree hierarchy and a title for what type it is, e.g. weapon, vehicle, npc, etc… \n The Assets table will contain information about a specific asset such as an image file or 3d object. The table consist of an id, a type id, src or location of the asset, title or name of the asset and a description.  E.g. Image of a “Toyota Bakkie” that is located at /assests/vehicles/toyota.png with the description:”A Red 4×4 Toyota Bakkie”. \n In order to execute queries on the database the sqlite3_exec function will be used. The code to do that follows: \n //Set query to executeq = \"CREATE TABLE t_type\"\"(\"\"'ID' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\"\"'PARENT_ID' INTEGER,\"\"'TITLE' TEXT\" \");\"\"CREATE TABLE t_assets\"\"(\"\"'ID' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\"\"'TYPE_ID' INTEGER,\"\"'SRC' TEXT,\"\"'TITLE' TEXT,\"\"'DESCRIPTION' TEXT\"\");\";rc = sqlite3_exec(db, q.c_str(), NULL, 0, \u0026zErrMsg);if( rc!=SQLITE_OK ){fprintf(stderr, \"SQL error: %s\\n\", zErrMsg);sqlite3_free(zErrMsg);} \n  \n Note that I do not test whether a table actually exist, maybe you can add that to your code as a bit of an exercise? \n Step 6It is now time to insert some data. The query to do that follows: \n q = \"INSERT INTO t_type('PARENT_ID','TITLE') VALUES (0,'VEHICLES');\"\"INSERT INTO t_type('PARENT_ID','TITLE') VALUES (0,'ANIMALS');\"\"INSERT INTO t_assets('TYPE_ID','SRC','TITLE','DESCRIPTION') VALUES (1,'/assets/vechicles/toyota.png','A Red 4x4 Toyota Bakkie');\"\"INSERT INTO t_assets('TYPE_ID','SRC','TITLE','DESCRIPTION') VALUES (1,'/assets/vechicles/ferrari.png','A twin-turbo F50 Ferrari, like the one John Carmack drives');\"\"INSERT INTO t_assets('TYPE_ID','SRC','TITLE','DESCRIPTION') VALUES (2,'/assets/vechicles/munky.png','A munky. It is a bloody munky');\"; \n  \n You can of course do more advanced stuff like getting the ID of the types and then use that in the query. \n A Fast way to check the data in the file is to open it with notepad or notepad++ to check the results; but I will not recommend that approach with big files. \n Step 7In order to query the data, a callback function needs to be declared. The declaration for that looks as follows: \n static int callback(void*, int, char**, char**); \n  \n  \n This callback function will be called for each row returned from the query. \n The first parameter of this function is not really used.The second parameter contains the number of columns.The third parameter is an array containing the value of each column as a char*.The Fourth and last parameter contains the Names of each column. \n An example callback function follows: \n static int callback(void *NotUsed, int argc, char **argv, char **azColName){int i;for(i=0; i\u003cargc; i++){printf(\"%s = %s\\n\", azColName[i], argv[i] ? argv[i] : \"NULL\");}printf(\"\\n\");return 0;} \n  \n And this is how it will be used: \n q = \"SELECT * FROM t_assets WHERE TYPE_ID=1;\";rc = sqlite3_exec(db, q.c_str(), callback, 0, \u0026zErrMsg);if( rc!=SQLITE_OK ){fprintf(stderr, \"SQL error: %s\\n\", zErrMsg);sqlite3_free(zErrMsg);} \n Expected Output: \n  \n And that is it..The full source code for main.cpp looks as follows: \n  \n #include \u003cstdio.h\u003e#include \u003cconio.h\u003e#include \u003ccstdlib\u003e#include \"sqlite3/sqlite3.h\"#include \u003cstring\u003e \n using namespace std;  \n static int callback(void *NotUsed, int argc, char **argv, char **azColName){   \n  int i;   \n  for(i=0; i\u003cargc; i++){  printf(\"%s = %s\\n\", azColName[i], argv[i] ? argv[i] : \"NULL\");  }   \n  printf(\"\\n\");  return 0;}  \n int main(void){ sqlite3 *db;    char *zErrMsg = 0;    int rc;    string q = \"\";    string dbName = \"game.dat\";      \n  //Attempt to open database. If it does not exist create it.    rc = sqlite3_open(dbName.c_str(), \u0026db);      \n  if( rc ){  fprintf(stderr, \"Can't open database: %s\\n\", sqlite3_errmsg(db));  sqlite3_close(db);  exit(1);    }      \n  //Set query to execute    q = \"CREATE TABLE t_type\" \"(\" \"'ID' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\" \"'PARENT_ID' INTEGER KEY,\" \"'TITLE' TEXT\" \");\" \"CREATE TABLE t_assets\" \"(\" \"'ID' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\" \"'TYPE_ID' INTEGER KEY,\" \"'SRC' TEXT,\" \"'TITLE' TEXT,\" \"'DESCRIPTION' TEXT\" \");\";      \n  rc = sqlite3_exec(db, q.c_str(), NULL, 0, \u0026zErrMsg); if( rc!=SQLITE_OK ){  fprintf(stderr, \"SQL error: %s\\n\", zErrMsg);  sqlite3_free(zErrMsg);      }      \n  q = \"INSERT INTO t_type('PARENT_ID','TITLE') VALUES (0,'VEHICLES');\" \"INSERT INTO t_type('PARENT_ID','TITLE') VALUES (0,'ANIMALS');\" \"INSERT INTO t_assets('TYPE_ID','SRC','TITLE','DESCRIPTION') VALUES (1,'/assets/vechicles/toyota.png','Toyota Bakkie','A Red 4x4 Toyota Bakkie');\" \"INSERT INTO t_assets('TYPE_ID','SRC','TITLE','DESCRIPTION') VALUES (1,'/assets/vechicles/ferrari.png','Ferrari','A twin-turbo F50 Ferrari, like the one John Carmack drives');\" \"INSERT INTO t_assets('TYPE_ID','SRC','TITLE','DESCRIPTION') VALUES (2,'/assets/vechicles/munky.png','Munky','A munky.

E.g. \n $createdate =\u0026 JFactory::getDate(time()); \n Note that you wil override the date everytime you save to the database. See if you can modify the model to set the create date only on new saves. :) \n  \n http://api.joomla.org/Joomla-Framework/Utilities/JDate.html \n \u003c?php$db = \u0026JFactory::getDBO();$query = \"SELECT `id`,`name` FROM#__town\";$db-\u003esetQuery($query);$townlist = $db-\u003eloadObjectList();  \n /*Create an instance of MySelectObject*/$mso = new MySelectObject(); \n /*Set values*/$mso-\u003eid = 0;$mso-\u003ename = 'Any Town';  \n /*Create an array for insertion*/$tmpArr = array(0 =\u003e $mso);  \n /*Merge with array result from query.

  "inline_text": "Hey y’all things are moving forward well for us here at the Fyresyde Kitchen and because of that we are launching a website and moving the blog over to our own domain.  Come on over to the new place and keep up with our journey into principled eating. \n You can find us HERE! \n Posted in Uncategorized\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n A few weeks back my wife and I had a conversation regarding the difference of living a life of faith versus living a life of fear.  One thought that came from our discussion was that a life of fear is a life where a person is in constant distress about what might happen.  \n Fear is such a destructive power.  Fear has the power to destroy men, it destroys their self-esteem, it destroys their courage, it destroys their faith.  \n  For those that consider themselves faithful Christians fear should be viewed as a sin.  For it is said in the scriptures that fear and faith can not abide together and so every time that we go into fear we are turning our hearts, might, minds, and strength away for the service of the Lord God and we begin to serve ourselves and our idols. \n  But fear is a double edged sword of deception, it can define itself as a state of agitation and anxiety or it can also be characterized as a state of awe and reverence.   Such nuances in labels may confuse those valiant disciples trying to navigate life’s waters everyday.  How do you fear God and have faith?  How do you keep faith in the face of adversity? \n  The scriptures give us many examples of faithful men and women who gave no heed to their fears and rejoiced in the glory of their God with faith.  David was such a one.  When David came to the camp of the army of Israel to see what progress there was in the war against the Philistines he learned of the champion of  the Philistines, Goliath, and of the fear that the soldiers of Israel had for this man.  David was shocked.  “Who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?” (1Sam. 17:26) he asked of the fearful men.  He asked the same question of Saul the king. \n As we all know David was sent to battle this giant of a man and with the faith and courage of God he “hasted, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine” (1Sam 17:48) and by the grace of God and with a sling and a single stone he overcame the fear of an entire army. \n  The scriptures also tell us a story of a man of great faith who after much tribulation found himself living a life of fear.  Job was an “upright” man who gave heed to the righteous side of fear, that is he held his God in great awe and reverence.  But one day the Lord gave leave to Satan to tempt , to try, and to afflict Job in his life. \n  Though Job never cursed the Lord during this time as we continue in the story we find that Job is living a life of fear.  “For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.  I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.”  It was Job’s friends who came to his aid.  Reminding him of the good he had done.  Telling them how he, Job, had been a forger of their own testimonies.  \n  But fear is a paralyzer of souls and a thief of power and it would prove to be sometime before Job would gain full recovery from this debilitating bout of fear.  He would, in fact, get to the point of being weary of his own life. \n  Fear is a deadly serpent whose venom is doubt and anger; hopelessness and grief.  If we are going to live the lives of abundance and grace that the Lord promises us we have got to live our lives in faith.  We have to rise every morning and immediately fill her hearts with joyful expressions and faithful thoughts. \n  We must remember the words of Harry Emerson Fosdick: \n Fear imprisons, faith liberates; fear paralyzes, faith empowers; fear disheartens, faith encourages; fear sickens, faith heals; fear makes useless, faith makes serviceable and, most of all,  fear puts hopelessness at the heart of life, while faith rejoices in its God.” \n Posted in devotional, Faith\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: abundance, Faith, fear, grace, Hope, joy, obstacles\t\t\t\t\t \n No one said it would be easy. \n Dear friends, if you are not extremely upset by the appalling amount of added sugar sitting on the shelves of your grocery store then you are not reading food labels before you purchase.  Sugar, corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup, evaporated cane juice, etc.  The list of disguises that sugar wears on a food label is astounding.  One of my favorite things to see on a label now is organic [insert added sugar item here].  I wonder if Robert Kenner (Food, Inc.) will expose these imposters of health food store shelves.  Just because it’s organic sugar doesn’t mean it’s not still sugar. \n In my quest to eat sugar-free [and flour-free when I can] there have definitely been ups and downs.  First of all, let me reiterate that sugar is addictive.  If you don’t believe me I challenge you to remove all added sugar from your diet.  This means don’t eat fruit because it has sugar or anything like that, a balanced diet is still important, I am talking about reading a label and if it has the word sugar or any of it’s devilish disguises listed put it back on the shelf.  This means certain brands of ground turkey stay at the store.  This means you need to find sugar-free recipes for many of your favorite condiments including, ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise and barbecue sauce. \n All-in-all I believe that I am doing well becoming a sugar-free chef.  It is definitely not something that has or will happen overnight.  I have found that the aftertaste and “cotton mouth” that I once ignored when consuming sugar-free foods is now not a sensation I’m willing to have everyday.  So I’ve looked at a number of alternatives in the sweetener realm.  Also, in the past I used sugar as a stress reliever.  This is currently my biggest obstacle personally in becoming sugar-free.  When stressful times come I crave a Maple Bar or and orange soda.  Fat free, Sugar Free ice cream has come in handy in this area.  But I’m still trying to find a “sweet” carry along that I find palatable that I can reach for when life gets stupid. \n Of course, my job, for now, prohibits me from going 100% sugar-free.  Especially on the days when we are developing new product or testing new recipes. It’s hard for others to be confident when you tell them that something tastes good if you haven’t actually tasted it before.  Other than that, however, I am still well on my way to becoming a 100% added sugar-free chef. \n As always I invite you to remove added sugar from your diet and to leave your comments regarding your ups and downs.  We can all use a little encouragement. \n Posted in Food, Sugar Free Cooking\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: addiction, Cooking, diet, Food, sugar-free\t\t\t\t\t \n All foods are not created equal!  \n Below are ten power packed foods designed to give you energy, vitality and all around good health! Try these super foods to get started on the right foot.   \n  1. Beans – Beans of all kinds (kidney, navy, lentils, chickpeas, Northern) are high in plant protein and low in fat, carbs and calories.  If fiber is a problem in your diet, eating a healthy portion of beans each day can keep your digestive system healthy. \n  2. Oatmeal – Oatmeal is a filling grain that also provides much needed fiber to keep hunger at bay and your blood sugar constant. \n  3. Fruits – Fruits are filled with antioxidants such as Vitamin C and A.  Antioxidants fight free radical damage in the body and reduce the risk of cancer.  The antioxidants in fruit boost the immune system to fight the effects of aging in the body. \n  4. Allium foods – This class of foods includes garlic, onions, leeks and shallots.  Allium vegetables help guard the body against the risk of cancer and many other ailments and some are known for lowering cholesterol.  They also help lower blood pressure and prevent blood clots.  Eating these power packed vegetables in their natural state especially garlic increases their health benefits.  \n  5. Salmon – Salmon is rich in protein and in omega-3 fatty acids which reduces the risk of heart disease and other conditions. Wild salmon is a fatty fish but it contains good fats proven to improve health in children and adults.  \n  6. Flax seed – Like salmon it contains omega-3 fatty acids.  These seeds also contain omega-6 and omega-9 fatty acids.  You get a lot of power to fight high cholesterol, heart disease and diabetes with this seed.  \n  7. Peppers – Peppers contain antioxidants like beta-carotene and Vitamin C.  Peppers range from mild and sweet to so hot you’ll be calling the fire department.  All peppers contain a substance called capsaicin.  Capsaicin has the properties of an anti-inflammatory, a pain reliever, lowers cancer risk and heart disease.  \n  8. Nuts and seeds – Nuts are high in fat but those fats are the good kind.  Peanuts, almonds, Brazil nuts, walnuts and pistachios are all providers of good fats and protein.  Nuts help to lower cholesterol.  Eat them right out of the shell with no additives. \n  9. Açai – This berry has become the media darling of the health and food industry as of late.  It is rich in antioxidants and increases energy.  You can get more done and look better while doing it.  \n 10. Yogurt – The fat free variety is good for you.  Yogurt contains calcium, Vitamin B, and protein.  If you don’t drink milk, yogurt is an alternative to get your calcium in to build strong bones and teeth.  Live yogurt also contains friendly bacteria to help promote a healthy digestive system. \n Okay so perhaps you won’t grow rich from eating a healthier diet.  However, building a better healthier body begins with what you eat and if you are choosing and eating the right foods perhaps one day you will wake up and find yourself on the cover of a magazine, your quality of your life improved as well as your life expectancy, therefore giving you more time to work on becoming rich, So maybe you can Eat and Grow Rich.  There is only one way to find out.   How about oat crusted salmon with a fennel and leek white bean stew for dinner? \n Posted in Uncategorized\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n As this father’s day approaches I have been doing a lot of thinking in regards to my own father.  My father, as a father, was flawed.  He could be judgemental and suspicious, harassing and sarky.  He was never emotional and if I had a perfect memory I probably could count on one hand the number of times he’s said I love you.  And growing up we had a tense relationship.   \n Fast forward the clock several years and here I am a father in my own right and it is so clear to me what it was my father tried to do for me.  I understand the frustrations a father feels when he feels like he can’t provide something of beneficial value to his children when they need it.  I know the deep soul wrenching agony to feel like you have let your family down.  I know the fear that despite all that you do you will lose one or all of your children to the world or death. \n My wife asked me the other day what I thought my father’s legacy would be when he died.  My response was “work hard and never give up.”  Trying to live up to that standard bar has often been a cilice in my adult life that at times pushes me ever forward with diligence and perseverance and at times has brought me to my knees in shame for falling so short of the mark.   \n One of my earliest memories of my father is so vivid and yet so disconnected that I have never figured out how much was dream and how much really happened.  When my father was working in the oil field he use to share with me his hopes of owning his own company some day.  I have a vivid memory that I am certain was a dream of my father showing me a garage full of vehicles that were going to be for his business.  Later in life my father planned less for this opportunity and focused more on others but the damage was done from that time forward I have been obsessed with the idea of owning my own business.  My obsession is deepend because I often wonder if my father had to forgo his dream in order to more reliably provide for his family.  This thought is one of the driving forces in my life – I want to succeed big enough for us both. \n One last memory to share about my father, though there are many that  I could share.  In 1994 my father drove me from Wyoming to Las Cruces, New Mexico where I attended New Mexico State University for a semester.  After helping me check in and move in my father shook my hand, gave me a hug, and began to cry.  At the time I think we were both a little embarrased in the moment and I remember after we parted ways I myself teared up and was frustrated at doing so.  I was, however, touched in the moment.  But that moment did not mean nearly as much to me then (and it meant a lot) as it does now.  When I think about it now I get overwhelmed imagining the number of emotions and memories and hopes my father simultaneously experienced at a level that it made a man, whom I have only ever seen cry twice, tear up to say goodbye to his oldest son.  \n Father’s day is a day to celebrate legendary men of honour, strength, and love from the generation before ours.  But it is also to support and encourage and edify the current generation of fathers many of whom are self-taught fathers living day to day just trying to get it right everyday.  I thank each and every one of those men for their example to me.  My children will be better people as I look to the example of my father and other honourable men who have worked hard and never given up on us their children. \n On this Father’s Day I would like to say to my father thank you for making me possible.  Thank you for accepting the divine call of a father becuase through all of the victories and failures, mistakes and successes as a father the person I am today was made possible and for better or for worse I am so grateful for that. \n Will you please share your memories, stories, and thanks with me and the readers of my blog this Father’s Day weekend.  Thank you. \n Posted in Family\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: Family, fathers, gratitude, Hope, Love\t\t\t\t\t \n So a good friend of mine who is living in the frosty paradise of Minnesota is working on a class assignment where they have to conceive and plan a restaurant.  She enticed me to here wall thread by sending me a message to read her restaurant post.  Of course, being a chef, I’m a sucker for a restaurant wall post so I bit.  That’s when I saw it was an assignment.  I read all of the comments and my magical soap box drop like a brick out of my nether-regions.  So before I could hijack her peaceful thread I took some deep breaths and told her I would post my thoughts here so that they would be accessible to her co-threaders and so I could be my usual long winded self and not feel bad about being this smelly dark pompous cigar cloud on her wall.  \n Don’t get me wrong.  I think that all of her friends had great comments and insights that I’m sure will be great for her assignment.  But when you ask for my opinion about restaurant concepts and design you’re asking for a very large piece of baggage to be unpacked and dumped forth. \n The overall responses were in the vein of cuisine themes or gimick themes.  \n Gimick themes (ie the dutch oven restaurant with covered wagons, or the mexican place with the cliff divers (Casa Bonita I think), etc)  most definitely have their place on the culinary landscape and they make great business sense because most are family friendly.  But being a chef I have a bit of an arrogant food snob side and I am not a fan of 99% of those restaurants.  Although if and when I get my own restaurant group running (see about the kitchen) I will definitely have one or two chain restaurant veterans on my staff because those people know how to make money in the food biz. \n Cuisine Themes.  One of her friends who talked about cuisines asked a question about why ethnic cuisines are generally poor quality in this country.  (Hold on let me see if I can find that soap box in my carpet bag…oh here it is) Okay I can get rather heated about this subject because here is the problem.  I am american so when I make Chinese food it will be American-Chinese food.  The only exception to this is a chef who has spent YEARS in the country of origin of that cuisine doing nothing but studying and practicing and absorbing the food and the culture.  Like Rick Bayless at Topolabampo in Chicago.   A cuisine is more than it’s spices and it’s varied foodstuffs it’s also it’s culture and it’s traditions.  If I want to cook authentic and delicious Indian food in America I need to move to India “become Indian” and then come back.  (P.S. this theory is slightly flawed because it is acually never going to make my food 100% authentic because I can not help but bring my own experience, culture, tradition, and palate to the stove and that is just as much an ingredient as coriander or saffron).  Even when natives come here and open a restaurant you sometimes find that their time here has changed there experience and has added something American to their food.  Plus sometimes the type, quality, etc of a key ingredient might be different here than in an origin country. \n So after all that here are some ideas for a restaurant(s) that I think my friend should look into. \n First of all Minnesota has some wonderful native ingredients including wild game and whole grains.  There is a great company out of St. Paul I think called Indian Harvest (www.indianharvest.com) that has some amazing grains.  I’ve introduced several to BYU this year.  Obviously with the posts on this blog I’m becoming an avid supporter of seasonal/local/sustainable/organic more so in restaurants even than at home.  (I’ll post more about that next week) \n Some restaurant models I like include the One World Everybody Eats Community Kitchen model out of SLC.  No Menu, No prices.  Everyone pays what they can when they can and the owners are making a statement and a profit.  I also like the Kogi Korean BBQ truck out of L.A.  I’d love to see that in a restaurant setting though I worry that it will dull the excitement because chasing the dragon seems to be a big part of the experience (extraordinary atmosphere is not just about a dining room).  Taco  \n My previous (twenty minute) restaurant experience had  a great mix of culinary ideas on it.  There was some Asian influence and some Mexican influence and a whole lot of American influence.  America has an amazing culinary heritage if you go looking for it. \n Anyway I hope, my friend, this helps.  If you want I can post some menu ideas on your wall to help further inspire you if you want.  Let me know. \n Okay this post is too long I’m going to end here.  Before I go though everyone check out a new link on my sidebar.  (bestamericanretreats.com) Okay, yeah I’m a little biased because I know the owners but these guys know their stuff. \n Posted in Uncategorized\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n In a comment to the post “Jesus is a Locavore” Kory made some great observations regarding the global consequences of worldwide locavorism.  Obviously he and I are not holding hands over this issue but I do think a lot of what he says is true.  But I think there is more that we can do and there is more that our ancestors did do centuries before locavore was even a word. \n While conventional agriculture degrades the environment and is not likely to work well in the long term; it is still much more profitable than organic agriculture.  That means that as long as we can make it bigger, cheaper, faster and as long as the economics of it continue to make good bottom line sense the free capitalist market will demand that it continues.  In the long run there will always be people who choose the easy option over the more environmentally friendly one.  Plus, with increased need for large amounts of food due to the expanding world population; we will soon run out of room to grow enough crops to feed everyone if we only use organic methods.  \n I was once taught by a church leader that as stewards of the faith and stewards of this earth it is our duty to teach the ideal.  We must teach “the letter of the law” and not “the spirit of the law” even though most will choose to live the latter.  So I have chosen to put forth this idea that the revealed standards of health in section 89 of the Doctrine and Covenants are best kept with a green and local lifestyle because more and more people are becoming concerned not only with the health of their families, but also with the health of the environment.  \n  Organic agriculture may become more prevalent as we become more aware of the negative environmental and physical effects of pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, hormones, and other chemicals.  It is believed by some, on the worldwide front, that families who use organic agricultural in developing countries may make more money than traditional farmers in the same areas and have a higher standard of living. \n Since neither type of agriculture seems to be going anywhere, it’s likely the two will have to coexist in the future.  The ideal situation would be that both methods were used in conjunction with each other depending on the environmental, financial, and political situation.  This way, people can have the benefit of increased yields from traditional agriculture along with the health and environmental benefits of organic agriculture.  The problem with this theory is that the two sides are unlikely to reach a compromise and work together any time soon.  These two different mind sets will probably be at odds until it is absolutely necessary to make changes.  \n  While organic agriculture may not be able to take over the world and solve all the environmental and dietary problems we face; it still has the ability to make an significant impact.  \n Posted in Food, Locavore, Organic Food, Organic Living\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Food, Green, localvore, Locavore, organic, sustainable agriculture, Word of Wisdom\t\t\t\t\t \n In her book Between Two Fires: Intimate Writings on Life, Love, Food, and Flavor Laura Esquivel talks about the sanctity of the hearth and the lessons that can be shared with the next generation there. This is a sentiment that resonates with me. I feel as if I could be used to share something with others while standing at the hearth. \n I have, yet again, become acutely aware of the Lord’s hand in my life not only at the hearth but away from it as well.    Often as I look back on my journey I see His hand at work.  I see many people He has brought into my life to challenge my doubts and my beliefs, questioned my choices, and bless me with opportunities to learn and grow. \n At times I find myself somewhat estranged from my Father.  I drift away from the prayer life or I become greatly disillusioned about something that He has put in front of me or allowed me to stumble over.  But I am always aware of His presence and His guidance.  \n Sometime after church services yesterday had completed my three-year old son got lost.  But the greatness of our God was never absent from me.  The Spirit told me that everything was fine and after searching the path home from church the Spirit told me to go back to the church, that he was still there and had never left.  Sure enough not thirty seconds after reentering the building there he was. \n This is not an isolated incident for me and though it doesn’t happen as often as I imagine it does for many of my spiritual role models, like Louis Giglio, Louis Palo, or Thomas S. Monson. It does happen, He does show me the goodness of His grace time and time again. \n  I must admit, however, that as I go through these “connected” days and as I meditate on His hand in my life I find myself slipping into fear.  Is it possible that He can have plans to use such a seemingly useless tool as an average-quality chef to bless the lives of others?  One thing that I know about this Divine Mentor of mine is that He likes to see me out of my comfort zone and there are times when I see a picture or hear a story about something that I would be uncomfortable doing and gently He whispers in my mind, “this too will come to you.”  So yes, maybe He does intend to use such a lowly tool as this or maybe He is just guiding me to a place where He will use someone greater than I to change and inspire me.  It would not be there first time. \n Posted in devotional, Faith\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: chef, Divine Mentor, grace, Holy Spirit, Hope, humilty, Jesus\t\t\t\t\t \n This past week or two I have experienced some sort of circular kismet or revelation…something that I can already see changing my life forever (again).  In 1992 I cold turkey began eating a ovo-lacto vegetarian diet (meatless diet that includes eggs and dairy).  By 1994 I had pretty much stopped drinking alcohol (not that I was ever much of a drinker) and I was never a fan of tea or coffee.  However, in 1998 as I prepared to enter the former culinary arts program at Utah State University I reintroduced meat to my diet.  In 1999 I was baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. \n Once again I have begun to seriously consider my dietary lifestyle and as I have struggled to make what are going to be radical changes (and changes that are proving more difficult to make than they were in 1992) I have found myself preparing a Sunday school lesson on the Word of Wisdom, a dietary and health code for members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints that is not unlike Kosher restrictions for Jewish adherents or Islamic halal standards.  This code is housed within the pages of the Doctrine and Covenants (D\u0026C) a book of scripture within the Latter-day Saint cannon. \n The verse that tripped the light switch was D\u0026C 89:11 \n Every herb in the season thereof, and every fruit in the season thereof; all these to be used with prudence and thanksgiving. \n You do not have to be a culinary professional like myself to know that “seasonal” is one of the pillars of the local and sustainable food movements.  For me, professionally,  the sustainable and local food movements have proven more a thorn and a nuisance than anything.  In my market the majority of consumers don’t understand why I don’t want to sell asparagus in January or why their honeydew and watermelon taste bland in December.   \n Also a problem is that I would love to be able to cook professionally in a manner that is in keeping with how I should and would like to be eating personally.  But the vegetarian, organic, sustainable, etc food market is not quite as lucrative in my neck of the woods (Central Utah) as in other parts of the country.  Or at least not from the employee view point.  The presence of national health food chains like Whole Foods and Sunflower and local markets like Good Earth show that there is a movement here it just seems less tapped into in comparison to nearby California, Oregon, or Washington. \n And so the saga continues I am changing my lifestyle and it seems that I have divine support in the matter.  I guess it is time to, in the words of a fellow church member, “…ask in the name of Jesus Christ for the self-discipline to change [my] lifelong and vanity cherished habits.” \n Posted in Faith, Locavore\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: chef, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, diet, Food, Green, Jesus, localvore, Locavore, organic, sustainable agriculture, vegetarian, Word of Wisdom\t\t\t\t\t \n I’m definitely starting to feel Kermit the frog’s life long pain.  It ain’t easy being green.  The more I concern myself with greening my life the more frustrated I become.  There is a reason that statistically so few Americans have made “major” changes in their homes to green their lifestyles. \n Today in Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco the film “Food, Inc.” will open with more openings in the coming weeks nation wide.  That will show some of the reasons for these slow changes.   But let’s face facts one of the biggest reason is money.  Fat is cheap and in today’s economy cheap is good.  Isn’t it? \n I have a hard time paying more for organic produce, Whole grain breads, and free range chicken when my monthly paycheck is barely covering the bills every month.  Proponents of green living are always talking about how much less expensive it is to buy organic because it doesn’t travel as far and it isn’t laced with harmful chemicals, therefore, cutting down on fuel costs and health care expenditures.  But guess what?  It costs me the same amount in fuel to drive to my local grocery store to buy non-organic as it does to buy organic and the non-organic removes less money from my bank account.  Also even though I have insurance through my job I can’t afford health care.  Despite the myth that having insurance makes it possible for more people to get health care if your paycheck isn’t making it to the end of the month paying for food, clothing, and shelter that extra $20 co-pay or $40 prescription is not affordable. \n Who knows in the word’s of Kermit maybe someday “When green is all there is to be/It could make you wonder why, but why wonder why/Wonder, I am green and it’ll do fine, it’s beautiful/And I think it’s what I want to be”  but right now I’m trying to eat healthier on the same money or less and organic doesn’t always fit the budget. \n Posted in Food\t\t\t\t\t\tTags: Food, Green, organic, sustainable agriculture\t\t\t\t\t \n Blog at WordPress.com.

Damn Sun in Scorpio :) Anyhoo, here are a few photos of what I've been up to. \n  \n         More news from the witch's stead soon! \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 09:41 AM  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (2)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n This week has been completely nuts. I've spent more time in waiting rooms this week than I care to think about (don't worry, everything is fine), and my house looks as though someone has broken into it and turned it upside down. Today I need to do some serious cleaning, before I even think about picking up a hook or the needles. \n Speaking of which, all the knitting I've done in uncomfortable chairs has assisted me in doing my shoulder in, so I will have to hook probably for today at least. Tomorrow I'm hoping to spend some quality time with the stole I'm making for Gabby at American Yarns. \n The time I have been at home this week, I've set up my new astrology web blog. You can check it out here . \n Also, I've just joined Plurk. I'm sure I need another social web site the same as I need another hole in my head but hey, it looks like fun. \n  \n I promise I will be more loquacious over the next few days. Thanks for bearing with me folks. :) \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 06:10 AM  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (0)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n    \n  \n These are both the Pretty Thing cowl pattern from the Yarn Harlot. Above it's worked in Red Hot Chocolate from Needlefood, and to the right, Camoflage from Lorna's Laces.  \n  \n  \n I'm a tad taken with cowls at the moment. I'm wondering if they would be better for the homeless than scarves. They are less chunky, but still very warm, and so small they would be easy to scrunch up and stash when not in use. Hmmm, will ponder that a bit more. \n  \n In other news, I'm going to be launching another blog soon, focusing on astrology. Stay tuned! \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 07:06 AM in knitting  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (0)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n This week I've cast on: \n The Pretty Thing pattern from the Yarn Harlot. We had our ups and downs initially resulting in two lots of frogging and starting over. I'm well into the pattern now, and enjoying it thoroughly. And it is certainly very, very pretty. It's not for me - no use for cowls in sub-tropical Queensland. I hope the recipient will be happy. I'm doing these on my new Addi circulars. They are great, but my one complaint would be that they aren't quite pointy enough. Unlike Knit Pros, which you could use as a weapon if you really wanted. \n Not quite casting on, as it's crochet, but I've started a blankie for my cousin's oldest son. I think I have the perfect teen boy colours, so I hope he likes it. His mother will love it because it won't show the dirt. \n I probably shouldn't mention the blanket I've started but not finished yet, or the two pairs of socks I still have on the needles. I probably should also not mention that I'm planning on casting on another pair of socks today - which will be a gift for the same lucky person who will be getting the cowl. \n  \n Have I mentioned that I would really love a clone? Or maybe the power of super speed. Hmm, the needles would probably catch on fire! \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 10:43 AM in crochet, knitting, Socks  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (0)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n I'm freshly home from the Brisbane Stitches and Craft show.  It was quite amusing as it was easy to spot the crafty people on the way there on the train. Mostly older women wearing eccentric handmade garb, or carrying handmade bags. I was astonished at the number of women trailing those bag-on-wheel things. I hope they managed to fill them up! \n  \n Funnier than that were the number of husbands sitting outside with a coffee and a newspaper, waiting for their wives to emerge. I do kinda feel sorry for crafting husbands, they seem to have limitless patience. \n  \n   \n The show itself was mainly geared towards quilters, scrapbookers and beaders. There were lots of very pretty sparkly things to look at. I ended up losing my mother and her friend (after they spent about half an hour in the first stall and I got tired of waiting for them) and wandered round by myself. It was a lovely morning. If you're a quilter, you'll need all day! \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 02:07 PM in Party!  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (3)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n Stephanie Pearl Macphee aka the Yarn Harlot, posed an interesting question in her blog the other day. How do non-knitters cope with stress? Or, is it that knitting attracts a certain type of person who needs maximum stress management? \n  \n As someone who suffers from an anxiety condition, knitting makes things tolerable for me. I can knit on public transport, which allows me to remove my focus from the crazies I'm on the train or bus with. It was particularly valuable on a day etched in my memory when an unwashed loonie got on the train, sat next to me and then said \"baaaa\" at regular intervals until we got to town (a good 20 minutes). My knitting helps me deal with being outside my comfort zone. Or, if I'm feeling particularly stressed out knitting helps bring me down so I can successfully interact with other people. It also helps me wind down at the end of the day. I can almost knit myself to sleep with that soothing repetitive motion. \n  \n  \n Would the world be a different place if kids were told to go do some knitting when they got cranky or stressed out?   \n  \n Knitters - how does the craft assist you in times of stress? \n  \n  \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 07:45 AM in Navel Gazing, Yarn Harlot  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (4)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n  \n    \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 02:45 PM in General Bitching, Navel Gazing  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (1)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n I'm not much of a sporting person, as I've mentioned in previous posts, but one of the sporting faces I've had respect for over the years is Frank Farina. Up until now. \n One of the things I've always found odd about Australians is the way we tend to treat our sporting heroes like rock stars. The various football leagues have had lots of trouble recently with their players misbehaving badly off field. These incidents are generally followed by the individual appearing dutifully remorseful for the cameras. For some reason, our sporting heroes are allowed to behave like unruly teenagers on their first night out on the town. Except teenagers have to stop drinking a lot earlier because they run out of money a lot more quickly than these men getting paid obscene amounts each year because they can kick a ball. \n  \n There is an anti drink driving campaign which runs on our television networks which states \"If you drink and drive, you're a bloody idiot.\" \n  \n Mr Farina is a bloody idiot. He was charged with drink driving for the second time in two years. This time, he was pulled over early in the morning (reports I've seen have reported times as being between 7 and 10 am) with a blood alcohol reading over twice the legal limit.There is no excuse for this behaviour for any member of the public, let alone a well renowned soccer coach.  Not only does Mr Farina deny that he has an alcohol issue, he is planning on suing the Brisbane Roar club due to their decision to terminate his contract because of his behaviour. Apparently, not driving while drunk was not a part of his contract. \n  \n Excuse me? \n  \n I am astonished at the suggestion that a sporting club should have to specify that a coach or player to not drink and drive. Should it also specify in a person's contract that they should not get drunk and beat up their partner? Surely if an action is considered an offence by the local laws, it should be taken as read that these behaviours won't be tolerated.  \n Sporting figures need to start taking responsibility for their actions and not expect that all will be forgiven because underneath, they are really top blokes. Grow up people, you are not that special. \n  \n I congradulate the Brisbane Roar club for taking such a stance and showing zero tolerance for such anti-social behaviour. \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 08:21 AM in Sports  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (1)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n I had such a full on day yesterday I completely forgot to blog! I hope the blogtober fairies won't smite me for this indiscretion! \n The reason I had such a huge day yesterday was that I had a job interview/try out kind of thing. Now it's a rare thing that you come away from an interview looking like this. \n  \n    \n The other night, I hit up the lovely Lesley from Chameleon Face Painting for a job. Yesterday I had a get together with her, and tried my hand at some face painting stuff, including completing someone's face (thanks again Lousie!) It was awesome fun, and Lesley has agreed to take me on and train me as a face painter.  \n I'm very excited. The idea of returning to a desk job was anathema to me. This is perfect. I'll be working with kids - and occasionally adults - and playing with pretty colours. Plus the witchlet is incredibly happy as I'll have to practice on her. She's been begging me for face paints for two years.  As soon as I'm a bit more skillful, I'll have a face painting party for her friends, so I will have a heap of little canvases to practice on.  \n On another note, it's one more sleep until Tina and Tim's wedding. Good luck kids! Hope you manage to get some sleep tonight!  \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 07:27 AM in face painting  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (1)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n  \n   \n  \n   \n I did finally finish Nellie's wavy blankie. I'm very happy with how it's turned out. If her birthday wasn't so close I'd keep it myself - it goes perfectly with my couch. Just kidding Nell. \n  \n  \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  \n  \n I'm just over halfway with my mother's birthday socks. \n Working with these wonderful dark, rich colours has made me realise something ...

  "inline_text": "AppTrust solutions are built upon one common theme: effective security controls enable secure applications. FYRM Associates helps organizations identify lapses in security control implementation and create application and organization-wide development plans to correct the root cause of vulnerabilities. Through the AppTrust Training, Assessment, and Certification, FYRM Associates enables organizations to produce secure applications in an efficient and cost-cutting manner.  AppTrust Secure Coding Training meets the PCI DSS Secure Coding Training requirements. \n The AppTrust Developer Training Class (ATDTC) provides students with the necessary knowledge to develop secure applications and create constructive environments that encourage secure application development. Through three days of intensive instruction, this course provides your developers, and ultimately your organization, with the ability to understand and combat current application security threats and vulnerabilities.

  "link": "https://fyreflybooks.wordpress.com/about/review-policy/",
  "inline_text": " \n Because of real-life commitments and time constraints, I need to greatly restrict the number of books I can accept for review for the foreseeable future.  If you are not a publicist/author with whom I’ve worked in the past, or whose books I have previously read, unfortunately I will not be able to accept your book for review at this time.  \n If you have a book you would like me to review, please first read this page, and then let me know about your book! (Books only, please; I keep things biblio-centric around here, and am not interested in featuring your website, diet program, or new flavor of gum.)  \n What kind of books do you accept for review?\nI read a variety of books in most genres, although my favorites are fantasy and sci-fi, young adult fiction, historical fiction, and non-fiction (especially science and microhistories).  I don’t often read crime/legal thrillers, heavy horror, and most memoirs, and I am not interested in self-help books or Christian fiction. \n Additionally, while I understand how difficult it is for authors to promote their work, I am not accepting self-published books for review at this time. \n What about e-books and audiobooks?\nI greatly prefer paper review copies, but I am willing to consider e-books (Kindle format) for review in exceptional cases.  I’ll happily consider audiobooks for review. \n What should I do before making a request?\nTake a look through my archives! Personalized requests that come from people who have clearly spent time browsing through my site are always appreciated, and are taken more seriously than generic form requests. \n What if I don’t hear from you?\nReal-life time constraints means that I can’t always respond to every query e-mail as quickly as I like, and that I can’t accept every book that looks interesting.  If you don’t hear from me, or if I can’t in good faith accept your book for review, this does not mean that I am not interested in hearing about other books you may have on offer in the future, so please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have something you think would be a good fit. \n What do you do other than reviews?\nI’m happy to host author Q\u0026As, giveaways, etc. to go along with my review.  However, please note that I do not do “book features” for books that I haven’t read and reviewed.  This site is a first and foremost a venue for me to share my opinions about what I read, and I’m not comfortable featuring books about which I have no personal knowledge.  \n What if you don’t like the book?\nI do my best to accept only books that I think I will enjoy.  However, I honestly review every book that I read, and my acceptance of a review copy does not guarantee a positive review. In cases where I did not enjoy a book as much as I thought I would, I always do my best to describe my reasons in such a way that my readers can draw their own conclusions about whether or not the book would be a good fit for them. \n What if you really don’t like the book?\nIn the very rare case that a book and I don’t get along to the extent that I can’t finish it, I will make every effort to pass it along to another reviewer for whom it might be a better match.  I will also occasionally hold giveaways to pass along ARCs that I have already read and reviewed.  If you would rather I did not re-send your review copy, please let me know this when you send it. \n Where will your review be posted?\nAll reviews will be posted here, as well as at LibraryThing. \n When will your review be posted?\nAlthough I cannot guarantee how quickly I will read and review books, I do my best to review ARCs before or shortly after their publication date; other review copies are reviewed in the order they are received.  If the date I post my review is important, let me know, and we can work out a schedule, although sufficient lead time (books received at least a month before the desired review date) is always appreciated. \n Okay, I’ve read this page.  How do I submit a request for a review?\nI appreciate your taking the time to check out my blog!  If you would like me to consider reviewing a book for you, please contact me by e-mail at fyrefly98 [AT] gmail [DOT] com. \n Do you only review books? What about short stories? \n Hi\nI was wondering if you would be interested in reviewing my book called Amelia’s Daughter? Its just about to go to press. http://www.philiplmoore.com  Thanks, Phil \n Hi: \n I just came across your marvelous site. I have a new thriller coming out in December.  The title is “Circle of Lies” and the publisher is Forge/Tor Books.  If you have the time I would love you to review it.  Assuming you are interested, I can either send it to you directly or have the publicity department do so. \n With kindest regards, \n Doug Alan \n What an interesting and intelligent book review site.

  "link": "https://fyrecurl.wordpress.com/",
  "inline_text": "\n\t\t\t\tThe feminine perspective\t\t\t \n And she stood above them on the ledge looking down\nDropping petals from marigolds and Pansies and a rose\nWatching them drift and twist slowly round\nWith fragile wings reaching for their destiny far below \n And when we got there she was already on the ground\nStaring up at us with a smile\nAs though she found the answer to her tears\nThere on her journey down \n The one that evaded her all those years\nAnd stood there still and leaning over the rail did I\nWaiting for a sign that all was well\nLong and hard and cold watching her lie \n And among those broken blossoms where she fell\nShe did not stir nor waver once nor even sigh\nLying among the flowers that i gave her\nwhen i said farewell \n Where there is fear there is hope, where there is darkness there is light, where there is suffering there is kindness, and where there is hate there is love. These are our weapons to counter oppression and bigotry. Be steadfast in your faith. America is great. \n  \n  \n   \n  \n   \n Some of us know too well the test of adversity and hardship and live in fear every day but still manage to put on a happy face and walk out the door. We have done it most of our lives. Having felt a little sunshine these past 8 years it is only natural to want more when storm clouds threaten to disrupt our picnic. However remember when the rain cometh this time things are different. If we have learned one thing in all of those early years of struggle, we are not alone. Women and men, straight and not so straight of every color, ethnicity and religion have banded together as Americans to build a new future. We have sanged and danced in the streets like children, laughed and even cried over tragedies that have honed our multifaceted  character into one unified people for justice and principles that we claim unilaterally are: American. We have faced civil unrest, the enslavement of a people, bombing of churches, wars to end all wars, the unfair internment of some of our friends and neighbors of oriental decent, Stonewall, McCarthyism, the atrocities of Viet Nam, Watergate scandals, infidelities from our trusted officials too numerous to mention, and the fall of the twin towers which led to the erosion of our most treasured right to privacy from government intrusion, and we have endured. Friends let the rain fall if it must. I am not afraid. I am an American. \n I’ve come to hate my body and all that it requires of me in this world …  \n                   Cindy was the speaker that first day I walked into the basement of Christ’s church. She sat cross-legged in the overstuffed chair at the corner of our circle looking like she got into a bout with a pit bull. Her lip was split, and her eyes blackened and purple, separated by a narrow white bandage across the bridge of her nose. Everyone was listening intently to what appeared to be a young woman in the “hot seat”, a box of tissue in her lap, sputtering in a little-girl voice about her boyfriend. \n  “After\nI informed him about my upcoming operation in Montreal, he made it abundantly\nclear he did not want to ever see me again. He broke my nose. It wasn’t\npretty,” she said and dabbed a dry eye with a tissue.  \n “He knocked out two of my front teeth. I had\nto scramble around on the floor after he had gone, looking for them so the\ndentist could put them back in.”  \n I had pictured a\nbunch of middle-aged men trying to dress like the woman of their dreams. Lost\nsouls trying to reinvent themselves into some idyllic embodiment of femininity\nthat they imagined when they were teenagers, before puberty rubbed them the\nwrong way. Instead, there was Cindy with her long brown hair tucked behind each\near, in her too-long sweater and a pair of thread-bare stirrups looking like a\nrebellious adolescent. When I found out she was a mechanic for a Sears Auto\nCenter, there was a connection. I was not just surprised but ecstatic. I felt\nthere may be hope for me yet.  \n Caught up in the\neuphoria, I asked her to lunch. I wanted to know more. We went to a small deli\non the outskirts of town. No one gave us a second look. Two girlfriends out to\nlunch.  \n Afterward, I let\nher drive my sporty 5-speed Honda Civic at top speed through the rolling hills\nof West Hartford to an apartment she shared with Laura. The two of them plied\nme with whiskey and wine, dressed me up like a prostitute and took me out to a\ngay bar near Amherst.  \n I woke up naked\nbetween them in an unfamiliar bed that smelled like sweat and vomit. I dressed\nquickly and drove back to Vermont. I barely glanced in her direction since that\nfirst meeting. It wasn’t long into my transition that I realized not every\nmember of my support group was the same kind of crazy as me.  \n  Traci was one of the first like me that I had met. At five feet four inches tall with diminutive features and a lovely face, she was that hot new model everyone at the XX Club aspired to be—no matter what variety of fruit they were. Traci  almost a half-million before coming into the XX Club. She and I were more financially stable than most of the others. It gave us some perks. Joe, the person I would eventually move in with, was more scrutinized by the gatekeepers. The clinic made him get his wife to sign off on his hormone shots, but he was undaunted.  \n “They pay more attention to me than you guys,”\nhe laughed. \n Canon Clinton\nJones, the club’s co-founder and social worker, usually sat in\none of the chairs facing the door and smiled at me and the others as we came\nin. Traci compared him to Saint Peter thinning out the flock of lost souls as\nthey came up to the pearly gates. He seldom spoke unless someone had a question\nfor him. He sat quietly, small white hands folded neatly on his lap, legs\ncrossed at the knee and observed while Jennifer, our club president, ran the\nmeeting. Canon Jones was there, he reminded us, to help us help ourselves. Our\njob was not so much to learn how to become women, but to unlearn all the years\nof living behind a mask of masculinity.  \n Jennifer\ndescribed it as peeling an onion, one layer at a time. It\nwould bring tears, but it was necessary before you could find that tender\nheart. Jennifer loved metaphors. She usually misquoted or mixed them up in an\nendearing sort of way. She was soft-spoken and plain and didn’t wear much\nmakeup. Her graying blond hair was tied up in a bun or stuck under some frumpy\nhat, and she always showed up in a long skirt and loose knit sweater like some\nold hippie chick. She looked like the grown-up version of Annie Hall.  \n Jennifer was one\nof the oldest members of the club and the main topic of conversation during our\nbreaks. No one was certain whether she had had SRS or not, but everyone held\nher in high esteem. We all knew her intentions were good. Besides, Canon Jones,\nand one of the former members who presided over my first meeting before leaving\nto parts unknown, she was one of the few people that appeared to care about our\nprogress and tried to be comforting.  \n She used to be an\nengineer at a big firm in Manhattan until she walked into the office one day\nwith her thinning blond hair tied back in a bun behind her head and in a long,\nknit skirt and cowl-neck sweater. Her partners called her into the boardroom\nand offered her an early retirement package she could not refuse.  \n When she was not\nrunning our meetings or arguing with her live-in girlfriend Julie, she stayed\nhome by a phone in her anteroom waiting for a call from her son. Gossip had it,\nwhen Jennifer’s ex-wife informed the boy what was going on with his father, he\nnever returned home from Penn State.  \n The greatest part\nof the gossip however was Julie, an ex-priest. She was a bit disconcerting to\nbe around. It was bad enough for most to descend into the bowels of a church\ndressed in ways that could get you arrested in the 1990’s and share intimate\nsecrets with complete strangers but she made it even more uncomfortable.  \n Julie was that\nnun from Hell, the one who dragged you out of your seat by the ear and stood\nyou in front of the entire class telling you that your zipper was open and\nforbade you to look down to see if it really was. Not only did her outfit\nresemble the Carmelite nuns that taught me for the first eight years of my\nacademic life, her mannerisms reminded me of my Seventh-grade teacher, Sister\nAloysius, right down to the nervous tic of her mouth whenever she scolded you\nfor slouching in your chair.  \n With the\nexception of Julie’s starched blouse that was usually\npetrified-white, she wore black like a second skin. Black dress, black sweater,\nblack-framed glasses, and her black hair tied back with a black ribbon. She\nwore black nun-shoes—the kind with a thick heel and blunt toe. Julie and\nJennifer lived together in Jennifer’s large stately home off King’s Highway in\nan old established neighborhood in Bridgeport.  \n Julie was still on the books as the club vice\npresident but seldom showed for meetings. When someone inquired, Jennifer would\nsay, “Busy bees must make honey while they can,” or “busy is, busy does.” It\ndidn’t really answer the question but stifled any further inquiry.  \n Most were thankful she didn’t come. No one\nwanted to be reminded to keep their legs closed or crossed at the knee if you\nwere wearing a dress or skirt or stopped at some penultimate moment at the\nclimax of a personal story shared with the group for the first time. She would\ntell someone if she thought the subject matter was inappropriate even on breaks\nand no one wanted to be reminded again and again that this was not a place to\nmake “new best friends” simply when you stopped to talk to someone after a meeting.     \n Traci’s boots\nwere on the floor under her chair. Her feet securely tucked up under her while\nshe huddled under her parka with the collar pulled up to her chin. Her breath\nfloated aimlessly up through the loose fabric. She caught me staring and gave\nme the thumbs up. She approved of my casual look—a pair of my daughter Jackie’s\nold jeans hugged my thighs and a long red sweater clung to my budding round\nbosom. If you could pass in androgynous clothing, you had made it.  \n Traci said no matter how good we look someone\nalways sees who we once were. Our past creeps through. My eyes narrowed on her\npretty face when she said it. I found it hard to tell the difference between\nher and any of my sisters. She was, without question, as cute as any teenage prom\nqueen.  \n “Don’t worry, you’ll get there. Give them\nmoaning whores time to do their magic.”  \n That’s what she called hormones. I was never\nquite sure whether she laughed at my insecurity or her little pundit. \n It was Traci who convinced me to move in with\nJoe for my year of living in my chosen gender, as required by the program.  \n “You can cart each other around from place to\nplace until all your surgeries are complete. No one can go through this alone.”\n \n When I asked who assisted her, she just\nsmiled. \n Traci planned on\ngoing deep stealth. She stayed to herself at meetings and avoided interaction\nwith anyone who might give her away. She barely talked to the others except\ncordially. Although not formally appointed, she was my mentor. By the time I\nmoved from Vermont to Hartford, she was halfway through with her ‘year\nof living dangerously’ as she called that time when we strapped our sex up\nbetween our legs and put on a dress, usually for the first time.  \n I was fortunate\nshe took me under her wing. I came dressed that first day in blue jeans and\nwork boots looking more like gay Bruce Springsteen than a Lola. I had no\nexperience dressing up as a girl except a few times on Halloween but that ended\nin the sixth grade, after my father told my mother I looked like a squirrel.\nAll I dared wear was a dab of mascara for fear of getting seen by someone I\nknew.  \n I had a key to my\nfriend, Frank’s, dental office in Brattleboro. He was never\nthere on weekends and I would stop by to use the bathroom and lightly line my\neyes with a black pencil and fluff out my curly hair with a pick, making my\nandrogynous appearance a little more feminine. But it wasn’t long after the\nhormones kicked in that my friends and people that I have known for years began\ntalking about me in those hushed whispers reserved for folks who claimed to be\nabducted by aliens. \n “Look at those two idiots.”  \n Traci jerked her head in the direction of two\nnewbies sitting across from us. She kept her voice low. \n “The tall blonde calls herself Proud Mary. She\nshowed up at the last meeting in a long red dress and a white sweater. A bloody\nmess.”  \n Traci had a euphemism for every regular in the\nclub and labeled the newbies if they came back a second time. Whenever she\ncalled me Saint Evelyn my stomach knotted but when she used the epithets that\nshe gave the regulars, I got more nervous.  \n Besides Joe, Jennifer and Scary Julie, the ex-priest, there was Sarah the eunuch and Laura the admirer. Cindy was the whiner of the group and Hawk-nose Kaitlyn was the youngest member to regularly attend our meetings. Both she and Cindy were in their late twenties and were rail thin. Traci called them Zeros. I didn’t know it referenced a dress size. I thought she was being derogatory, like all her other labels.  \n “Joe calls her Big Kathy,” I said referring to\nthe tall blonde. Traci was unconcerned with what other people thought. I never\nrealized how prejudiced she was towards our own kind.   \n “Like most of these freaks she works in IT and\nis married. Isn’t that Barbie?”  \n Traci nodded in the direction of a newbie in a\nwhite dress. \n “No, I don’t think so. She’s Hispanic. Her\neyes are slanted. Barbie had big eyes like the doll, remember. That’s why we\ncalled her that.” \n “Cripes! That’s right. It’s hard to keep track\nof all the freaks. Where do they all come from?”  \n Jennifer brought\nher finger up to her thin colorless lips. Petite Cindy was in the ‘hot\nseat’ blubbering something about stenosis and an opening the size of a pencil\nnub. She was always crying or feigning emotional trauma to draw sympathy. Her\nlarge dark eyes looked down into her empty lap. Cindy spoke in a\nmonotone-droll-little-girl voice. Her eyes were wide-open and dry. There were\nno tears, but people around her, especially the newbies, feigned empathy as\nthough it was expected of them.  \n People didn’t\nnormally cry at meetings. Most of our tears were used up long ago as children.\nSelf-pity is unusual for a tranny who survived past puberty. It succumbed to an\nemotional cancer that spread quietly into the trauma of our teen years when we\nnoticed the developing bodies of the girls born in the right body. Pity was\nreplaced by an emptiness and self-loathing before we became adults.  \n Some had a chip on their shoulder, but when\nmost first came to the club and realized they were not alone they were elated\nor relieved. No one cried in a meeting unless it was a story about them. How\nshe was molested by a family member or sitting in a warm bath at the age of six\ncontemplating how to cut off the male genitals that did not belong on her body\nwithout bleeding to death.   \n Jennifer liked\nCindy for some reason. She often sat in the hot seat. Cindy retold her story\nabout her botched operation by an incompetent Montreal surgeon at almost every\nmeeting. We were the experimental people. Dr. Menard had tried a new spiral\ngrafting procedure to improve on the healing process of the neo-vagina.\nHowever, something went horribly wrong, if you believed Cindy.  \n “Cindy is a drama queen,” Traci said. She\nthought Cindy failed to follow directions and insert the prosthetic device into\nthe raw wound twice a day to keep it open until it healed. I pictured the\nlittle girl in The Exorcist stabbing\nher crotch when she said it and winced. Physical pain to pacify our emotional\ntrauma. \n  Sarah’s\nhair was cut short like a boy’s but he looked and sounded like a woman because\nhe never went through puberty. He contracted syphilis when he was 9. That’s\nwhen his mother’s boyfriend moved into their trailer. Sarah told me he used to\nsneak into her room at night when her mother passed out from the drugs that he\ngave her.  \n “He was a sick man.”  \n She almost\nsounded sorry for him.  \n I felt sorry for\nSarah. She didn’t talk much. When she did, it was usually to\ncertain people like me or Laura, who she moved in with when she came up from\nthe New York City. Laura and Sarah were not real members of the XX Club.\nNeither were candidates for sexual reassignment, but Canon Jones let them join\nthe support group whenever they felt like killing themselves.   \n Sarah didn’t\nmake eye contact. She usually looked down at her feet when she spoke or at her\nlap if she was sitting. Her voice was low, and you’d have to strain to hear it.\nShe didn’t talk much to the others, but for some reason, she did talk to me.  \n Everyone seemed to confide in me and tell me\nthings I did not want to hear, especially Joe. Sometimes people told me too\nmuch—those dirty little secrets that should be locked in a box in the back of a\ncloset or swept under a bed. I kept a smile pressed to my lips and listened and\ntried not to think about how it would affect me.  \n From meeting to\nmeeting, I barely remembered the ones I saw from the previous month. A handful\nof newbies came and went from time to time, but no one noticed when they didn’t\nshow up again. We were keenly aware that only a handful would make it out alive\nand were relieved when we were still sitting in that imperfect circle of\nchairs.  \n One week several\nnewbies appeared at once. A Konstanz with a “Z” she said,\nthen a Bronwyn, and our hawk-nosed Katlyn paraded in wearing heels and heavy\nmakeup probably for the first time. The more flamboyant monikers revealed a\nchange in attitude among the community as if they were no longer ashamed of\nbeing born odd. They reinvented themselves like children playing in a\nmake-believe world pretending to be something different than they were born—not\nquite a white knight, a soldier, or cowboy but almost always a damsel in\ndistress.  \n I didn’t\nknow why anyone would want to be a victim but some of the newbies tended to\nrevel in it like it was their destiny. They came in to challenge the\ngatekeepers, who tried without success to screen them out. The clinic staff\nfound the majority of the support group were these new gender-warriors, many\nalso in need of services. They did not want to change their sex. They\ndisappeared at an alarming rate when they or Canon Jones realized the program\nwas not designed to accommodate them. \n We turned off\nreality. When someone was missing at the next meeting, we did not ask\nquestions. They could be dead or just decided to revert back to the real world\nand hang up their heels for a while. We never knew. We’d see a newbie sitting\nin a chair where the recently deceased should be and we’d go on acting as\nthough they showed up again—transformed. \n I attended\nseveral meetings, twice a month, while still living at home in Vermont. But as\nthe hormonal therapy progressed, and I began to look and feel differently, I\nknew I had to leave the safety of my home and family if I was to ever become\nthe person, I knew I was meant to be.   \n\n#\n\n\n\n \n By: Michelle Berthiaume \n        *** Soon to be released  *** \n The 1990s was a dangerous time to go against their Makers design … \n  \n Speak to me dear poet,\nlet me hear your gentle voice before the dawn and regret seeps in through the tattered curtains of my life.\nLet your words pour through my weary bones, refresh my soul with your divine,\nI am, for these fine moments before the light, your instrument,\nplay hard until comes the day with all its revelry and spite.\nLeave your mark upon me so all will know that I was yours and you were mine this last beloved night. \n Speak to me dear poet,\nlet me hear your gentle voice before the dawn and regret seeps in through the tattered curtains of my life.\nLet your words pour through my weary bones, refresh my soul with your divine,\nI am, for these fine moments before the light, your instrument,\nplay hard until comes the day with all its revelry and spite.\nLeave your mark upon me so all will know that I was yours and you were mine this last beloved night. \n A Daughter is a rose without thorns . . . – Emily Michelle McNamee \n ___________ \n When he died, Da was only forty-five. They lied to Ma and said he fell off his horse. I knew it was not the fall that killed him. Not that a games-keeper for the Kings’ estate in County Cork could not fall off his horse. I’d seen Da do it after a visit to Killian’s Pub but I’d seen the leaves on the morn of his death and knew. The lord of the manor had come all the way from England for the annual hunt. He come into the kitchen and had me do his reading when Da was outside hitching up the wagon. I curtsied and told him: “Nah, Sir, I am forbade to read the leaves. If Father McGinnis finds out, there’d be the devil to pay.” Lord Kensington laughed. \n “It’s not for real, Lass. It’s for entertainment.” Although I was barely eleven, my skills with alchemy and other gifts were legendary among the Baile. “Come now. Let’s see what ya can do. You are the seventh daughter of the seventh daughter, are you not?” \n I nodded and fetched the pot from the stove and prepared his cup. I no sooner poured the water over the dried leaves and the chill fell upon me. I shuddered. He laughed and helped me steady the pot back onto the stove. His hands stayed on my shoulders and slid down to cover my hands. They were soft for a man. Not a callous or scar on them. he twirled me around as if to study me. Then of a sudden he let go and sat back down. His eyes bade me to go on.  \n When he was through his breakfast including the tea I poured him he put his cup on the table, sat back and bade me to sit upon his lap. My sisters stood in the corner staring at their shoes. As lord of the manor our whole family were his servants. None dare deny his command. I stared into the bottom of the empty cup staring at the pattern the leaves had formed. when they all had seemed to settle into place, it presented itself in Olde English, a language of his ancestors that I was least familiar. As a daughter of the head games-keeper, I had learned all manner of things beyond my station to assist the ladies of the men who came to the manor for the hunt. From the various guests I learned French, Welch, Gaelic, and some Olde English. It was the hardest to learn, taught me by the Lord’s spinster sister, Cecile, who used to accompany him in the years when she could ride.  \n “Well, girl, hurry up. I don’t have all day. We got game to catch.” My sisters snickered nervously from the corner by the stove and his man, Charles, who tended to his personal needs, stood somberly to one side holding his boots.  \n “It’s hard, Sir. It’s in a difficult tongue. I have to wait for the images to form in me brain. You have a different linage. I—” I stopped suddenly when it came to me as if spoken into my ear by some faerie passing through. “A man will die on the hunt this day,” I cried in a voice much too old for me and that vibrated as if more than one person was speaking from far away. I pulled away from his grasp. Startled by my outburst, he let go of me and I landed on the floor on the pads of my feet. He held the table to steady himself as he stood. Perhaps he thought I meant him.  \n “Nonsense, girl.” He shouted. “You disappoint me.” I saw his blue eyes widen before he ran out the back door in his stocking feet with Charles chasing after him. I ran out the front where I knew Da was waiting with the wagon. It was his job to show the Lord and his party where the beasts would be hiding and carry back the prizes of the day in his wagon.  \n “Da, don’t go!” I screamed. Dark clouds were already forming on the horizon above the gables.  \n “Katie, calm down. We’ll be back ‘afore the sun falls. Tell your mother to prepare stock for venison.” He was laughing at me. I nearly took a fall. “It’s a fine day. Cernunnos smiles upon the McNamee. A big white on the mountain goin’ a fall. I know—” \n “The stag is in the heather, not on the hill and ’tis an omen, Da.” I finish for him. It got his attention. I’d broke my promise. He knew. His face turned ashen then red.  \n “Katie, go back inside. I’ll deal with ya when I return.” \n “No, don’t go.”   \n “Katie!” He raised the whip in his hand then clutched his chest with the other. I ran back inside to tell Ma. But it was too late. Pa was already chasing his big white stag in the heather. \n It was dusk when the horn sounded and the hunt was over. I sat stone still on the swing on the back porch. I hovered, bare feet dangling over the edge, looking out over the heather, a Norse wind teasing the ends of my skirts then it lifted me. I am on the wagon beside my Da. We sit in silence looking down across the spotted back of Martha, feeling the warmth of the late afternoon sun on our faces as she trots down the lane toward home. He looks happy to see me. All my witchery forgotten. He looks to the sea toward Neamh. His old eyes smiling. He squeezes me hand and together we begin: “And I’d give the world if she could sing, that song to me this day.”  \n   \n Her name is Jen Rose. She is my daughter and I have learned a lot from her on how to be an  empowered woman in an ever-changing world. Even as a child her inner strength and compassion radiated to everyone around her. Somehow she managed to rise up from being a petite introverted girl to become the hero others, boys and girls alike, admired and strove to emulate. Granted, her ubringing was not conventional. The Airforce moved us around the country when she was small but prior to starting school we settled down in a small town in Central Vermont where they had a progressive school system. She began playing sports,  particularly soccer, since she was first able to walk. I coached her and her younger sister, Jaq, and dozens of other children in a youth sports program designed to introduce, the then foreign sport, to a city that prided itself on it’s hockey, football and baseball championship teams. By the time Jen Rose was in seventh grade she was playing softball, basketball, bowling, track and soccer nearly year round along with her baby sister and began to gain regional attention. When she broke her leg in a soccer match shortly before basketball season she asked the doctor for a walking cast so she could keep active. I don’t think the doctor anticipated she would be clip-clipping up and down a court in front of cheering crowds to help her team to victory. A week after the cast came off she called me on the telephone and told me had assembled the first ever girls’s team to compete in a summer soccer league and then informed me that I was the coach. That summer both Jaq and Jen Rose were scouted and picked up by an international girls youth soccer team from the state’s largest city. We traveled to Canada where both Jen Rose and Jaq distinguished themselves as two of the state’s premiere players to contend with. Jen at midfield and Jaq, who had shot up to be the tallest girl in her class, as goalie. The area newspapers adored Jen Rose and covered her extensively as she progressed. She was hailed as the best female athlete to hit Central Vermont and filled a scrap book of clippings more than an inch thick. Despite all of the adoration she never let it go to head and always praised the other players on her teams. She managed to keep up her grades to remain in the top third academically in her class and in her senior year she wrote, directed, acted and choreographed the Senior school production of Let’s Put on a Play with her sister, Jaq,  in the lead role. That same year she and her sisters bowling team won the state finals. Immediately after the last ball rolled down the lane, we drove 2 hours to Smith College in Massachusetts so that she could compete in the regional track meet. She took third in the 440 meter race.  The day that Coach Ventriglia called to inform her that she had a position on the Lady Knights, West Points’ prestigious women’s soccer team, Jen Rose, and her little sister, Jaq, played in a match that would culminate their illustrious athletic careers at Spalding Regional High school. With several broken meta tarsals in both feet, in double over time and with one player down, Jen  came out of sweeper position to rush down the field to score the winning goal against a team that hadn’t lost a game in three consequetive seasons. The papers credited the win to her and “Jen’s little sister”. Jaq earned the title of “spider woman” for the countless spectacular saves in net. That Spring, Jaq, requested she play on a separate softball team citing she as tired of being referred to as: Jen’s Little sister.  As fate would have it the two teams were pitted against each other in the softball state finals with the winner representing Vermont in the regional at Amherst. Jen’s team went to the regional tournament. She weathered her Parents divorce the breakup of her family and the trials and tribulations of being one of the few female cadets at USMA at West Point during a difficult period and graduated in 1997. She went onto play soccer for the Army winning a gold medal before she hung up her cleats. She served along side her little sister, in many overseas campaigns including Bosnia, Kuwait,  and took over a command in Baghdad before leaving the service to raise her own family.  Although, her athletic and military careers were impressive and as her parent made me proud of her accomplishments. The one thing that will for her stand out in my mind was the time we took her and some of her friends to Ben \u0026 Jerry’s for ice cream. When we were ordering at the counter we discovered she was missing. We frantically ran outside and spotted her across the street assisting an elderly man with his groceries. I am so very proud and grateful to God, she is my daughter. She now has two daughters of her own she raises with her military husband. She put away her scrap book, medals and trophys. Keeping them out of sight, in some drawer of an old dresser and on a shelf collecting dust in the back of her closet, where they can do no harm. She is trying not to influence her daughters or make them feel they must compete or follow in her wake. When I tell them their mother was a superstar they look at me and smile as though I’ve told them some fairy tale. To them, she is a Wonder Woman because she’s: Mom.  \n A wealthy merchant bought land in a village so he could build a house overlooking a great mountain. He hired a magic elf to construct his home and gave him the plans. When it was finished the man noticed the elf had followed his plans perfectly except there were only two windows both placed side by side facing the mountain. The man confronted the elf and demanded an explanation. “Why did you only put in two windows when I told you I wanted to see the world in all its grandeur!” The elf said: “I followed your instructions. One window is when you wish to see the world as it is. The other is for those days you wake up and see the world as you wish it to be.” Still furious when the elf left he decided to see which window gave him the best view. There were no markings to indicate which was the wishing view. They looked identical and when he looked out he saw the same view of the mountain. \n A week later he saw the elf again on the street and the elf asked him how he liked his view. \n The man retorted: “Each morning I wake up and go to the window on the left and look out and then the one on the right and see the same mountain. There is no difference.” \n “You’re not wishing hard enough. Go home and give it another try. This time think about the way you would like it to look before openning the curtains,” the elf said then disappeared into the crowded market. \n So the man went home and this time he thought about the wild flowers he used to see growing on the side of the mountain when he was a boy but when he opened his eyes he saw only the same stark view of the mountain from both windows. Still angry with the elf he went back to the town and when he couldn’t find him he bought a ton of wildflower seeds from a farmer and hired workers to plant them on the side of the mountain. \n In the Spring he marveled at the sight of the mountain with its splendid colors from all of the wildflowers he had planted but when he looked out of the window on the right the view was the same. \n When the man saw the elf on the street that morning he confronted him. “Elf, I did as you instructed but the views from each window are the same.” \n “Tell me, my friend, is the view the same as when I constructed your house?” \n The wealthy man smiled. \n Each and every night, without fail\nI breach the inky darkness lunging dripping wet,\nI fall beneath the fragile surface of a dream, transcending space and time, without regret,\nSearching and soaring mile after scathing mile, beneath a scarlet moon, \n Falling and melding into the endless void \n to find you … \n MOM: Here you can have these chocolate covered nuts if you like.\nMe: “What are they?” I ask, as she pours me a handful. \n Mom: IT’S some kind of gormet candy I picked up at the store. supposed to be chocolate covered nuts but taste like coffee. \n  \n Me: I thought you liked candy. Save it for the movies.\nMom: Well, I don’t like them.\nMe: Why not? What’s wrong with them? And why are you giving them to me?\nMom: They taste good but they make me diggity.\nMe: Diggity?!\nMom: Yeah, I.must be allergic to these nuts bc after I ate some I felt irritable and couldn’t stop movin around. I walked up to the kitchen four times last night. Only slept a half hour. Couldn’t sleep.\nMe: They’re not nuts, Mom. They’re coffee beans. Full of caffeine. If I had one, I’d be awake till midnight.\nMom: Oh …\nMe: Where’s the rest of them? There’s only a few left in this bag.\nMom: That explains why I only slept a half hour all night.\nMe: Give them to me. No more gormet chocolate covered coffee beans for you. You’re 86, lucky your heart didnt give out.\nMom: maybe you can give the candy to April and Jim …\nMe: oh, boy! \n Dark days are merely days with less sunshine in them. We all have them. Some more than others. Addiction, neglect, self-loathing, fears and maladies of all types. They creep into our lives when we least suspect, sometimes right after having a baby and no one fully understand why. Everyone deals with it differently. I use prayer, meditation and exercise to stimulate endorphins in the brain to feel better. Writing or some other form of artistic expression also helps particularly in those darker days with less light. We used to live with layers of generations in one home or close by and the frequent contact of our social circle often made one feel less alone. But alone is how you must face your problem in the final scheme of things bc even those you feel comfort and cherish advice from cannot live your life for you. You have to choose if you want to feel better. No one can do that for you. Find solace in knowing that you have already accomplished much more in your lifetime than many and have friends and family who love you dearly. Take that love and stop feeling you can’t give back a hundredfold of what they give you. A doctor once told me after my first suicide attempt at thirteen, to run and not stop until you can’t. As long as you can keep running, you’ll find something in life worth running to. GOOD luck. Feel better soon. \n All my love and encouragement, \n FyrecurlShare \n  \n Tweet \n  \n  \n Email \n Print \n  \n  \n Share on Tumblr \n  \n  \n  \n Share \n  \n Tweet \n  \n  \n Email \n Print \n  \n  \n Share on Tumblr \n  \n  \n  \n Share \n  \n Tweet \n  \n  \n Email \n Print \n  \n  \n Share on Tumblr \n  \n  \n  \n Share \n  \n Tweet \n  \n  \n Email \n Print \n  \n  \n Share on Tumblr \n  \n  \n  \n  \n Share \n  \n Tweet \n  \n  \n Email \n Print \n  \n  \n Share on Tumblr \n  \n  \n  \n Share \n  \n Tweet \n  \n  \n Email \n Print \n  \n  \n Share on Tumblr \n  \n  \n  \n Share \n  \n Tweet \n  \n  \n Email \n Print \n  \n  \n Share on Tumblr \n  \n  \n  \n Share \n  \n Tweet \n  \n  \n Email \n Print \n  \n  \n Share on Tumblr \n  \n  \n  \n Share \n  \n Tweet \n  \n  \n Email \n Print \n  \n  \n Share on Tumblr \n  \n  \n  \n Share \n  \n Tweet \n  \n  \n Email \n Print \n  \n  \n Share on Tumblr \n  \n  \n  \n Share \n  \n Tweet \n  \n  \n Email \n Print \n  \n  \n Share on Tumblr \n  \n  \n  \n Share \n  \n Tweet \n  \n  \n Email \n Print \n  \n  \n Share on Tumblr \n  \n  \n  \n Share \n  \n Tweet \n  \n  \n Email \n Print \n  \n  \n Share on Tumblr \n  \n  \n  \n Share \n  \n Tweet \n  \n  \n Email \n Print \n  \n  \n Share on Tumblr \n  \n  \n \n\t\n\t\tFeaturedDestiny’s Child\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\nAnd she stood above them on the ledge looking down\nDropping petals from marigolds and Pansies and a rose\nWatching them drift and twist slowly round\nWith fragile wings reaching for their destiny far below\n\n\n\nAnd when we got there she was already on the ground\nStaring up at us with a smile\nAs though she found the answer to her tears\nThere on her journey down\n\n\n\nThe one that evaded her all those years\nAnd stood there still and leaning over the rail did I\nWaiting for a sign that all was well\nLong and hard and cold watching her lie\n\n\n\nAnd among those broken blossoms where she fell\nShe did not stir nor waver once nor even sigh\nLying among the flowers that i gave her\nwhen i said farewell\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t__ATA.cmd.push(function() {\n\t\t\t\t\t__ATA.initDynamicSlot({\n\t\t\t\t\t\tid: 'atatags-26942-60a78fd2e6a57',\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlocation: 120,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tformFactor: '001',\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabel: {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttext: 'Advertisements',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcreative: {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treportAd: {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttext: 'Report this ad',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprivacySettings: {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttext: 'Privacy',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\tShare this:ShareTweetEmailPrintShare on TumblrLike this:Like Loading...\t\n\n\t\n\t\tPosted byFyrecurlDecember 2, 2016July 3, 2019Posted inDepression, feminism, Gender issues, LGBTQ, Love, Philosophy, Poetry, Romance, Women and Society, Writing1 Comment on Destiny’s Child\t\n \n \n\t\n\t\tFeaturedAmerica is Great.\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\tWhere there is fear there is hope, where there is darkness there is light, where there is suffering there is kindness, and where there is hate there is love.

We have done it most of our lives. Having felt a little sunshine these past 8 years it is only natural to want more when storm clouds threaten to disrupt our picnic. However remember when the rain cometh this time things are different. If we have learned one thing in all of those early years of struggle, we are not alone. Women and men, straight and not so straight of every color, ethnicity and religion have banded together as Americans to build a new future. We have sanged and danced in the streets like children, laughed and even cried over tragedies that have honed our multifaceted  character into one unified people for justice and principles that we claim unilaterally are: American. We have faced civil unrest, the enslavement of a people, bombing of churches, wars to end all wars, the unfair internment of some of our friends and neighbors of oriental decent, Stonewall, McCarthyism, the atrocities of Viet Nam, Watergate scandals, infidelities from our trusted officials too numerous to mention, and the fall of the twin towers which led to the erosion of our most treasured right to privacy from government intrusion, and we have endured. Friends let the rain fall if it must. I am not afraid. I am an American.\nShare this:ShareTweetEmailPrintShare on TumblrLike this:Like Loading...\t\n\n\t\n\t\tPosted byFyrecurlNovember 10, 2016Posted incurrent events, Essay, Freedom of Speech, Philosophy, Politics, Society, Women and SocietyTags:election, President, society, Trump1 Comment on I’m an American\t\n \n \n\t\n\t\tFeaturedLove is not so much overrated as it is misunderstood.

She sat cross-legged in the overstuffed chair at the corner of our circle looking like she got into a bout with a pit bull. Her lip was split, and her eyes blackened and purple, separated by a narrow white bandage across the bridge of her nose. Everyone was listening intently to what appeared to be a young woman in the “hot seat”, a box of tissue in her lap, sputtering in a little-girl voice about her boyfriend.\n\n\n\n “After\nI informed him about my upcoming operation in Montreal, he made it abundantly\nclear he did not want to ever see me again. He broke my nose. It wasn’t\npretty,” she said and dabbed a dry eye with a tissue. \n\n\n\n“He knocked out two of my front teeth. I had\nto scramble around on the floor after he had gone, looking for them so the\ndentist could put them back in.” \n\n\n\nI had pictured a\nbunch of middle-aged men trying to dress like the woman of their dreams. Lost\nsouls trying to reinvent themselves into some idyllic embodiment of femininity\nthat they imagined when they were teenagers, before puberty rubbed them the\nwrong way. Instead, there was Cindy with her long brown hair tucked behind each\near, in her too-long sweater and a pair of thread-bare stirrups looking like a\nrebellious adolescent. When I found out she was a mechanic for a Sears Auto\nCenter, there was a connection. I was not just surprised but ecstatic. I felt\nthere may be hope for me yet. \n\n\n\nCaught up in the\neuphoria, I asked her to lunch. I wanted to know more. We went to a small deli\non the outskirts of town. No one gave us a second look. Two girlfriends out to\nlunch. \n\n\n\nAfterward, I let\nher drive my sporty 5-speed Honda Civic at top speed through the rolling hills\nof West Hartford to an apartment she shared with Laura. The two of them plied\nme with whiskey and wine, dressed me up like a prostitute and took me out to a\ngay bar near Amherst. \n\n\n\nI woke up naked\nbetween them in an unfamiliar bed that smelled like sweat and vomit. I dressed\nquickly and drove back to Vermont. I barely glanced in her direction since that\nfirst meeting. It wasn’t long into my transition that I realized not every\nmember of my support group was the same kind of crazy as me. \n\n\n\n Traci was one of the first like me that I had met. At five feet four inches tall with diminutive features and a lovely face, she was that hot new model everyone at the XX Club aspired to be—no matter what variety of fruit they were. Traci  almost a half-million before coming into the XX Club. She and I were more financially stable than most of the others. It gave us some perks. Joe, the person I would eventually move in with, was more scrutinized by the gatekeepers. The clinic made him get his wife to sign off on his hormone shots, but he was undaunted. \n\n\n\n“They pay more attention to me than you guys,”\nhe laughed.\n\n\n\nCanon Clinton\nJones, the club’s co-founder and social worker, usually sat in\none of the chairs facing the door and smiled at me and the others as we came\nin. Traci compared him to Saint Peter thinning out the flock of lost souls as\nthey came up to the pearly gates. He seldom spoke unless someone had a question\nfor him. He sat quietly, small white hands folded neatly on his lap, legs\ncrossed at the knee and observed while Jennifer, our club president, ran the\nmeeting. Canon Jones was there, he reminded us, to help us help ourselves. Our\njob was not so much to learn how to become women, but to unlearn all the years\nof living behind a mask of masculinity. \n\n\n\nJennifer\ndescribed it as peeling an onion, one layer at a time. It\nwould bring tears, but it was necessary before you could find that tender\nheart. Jennifer loved metaphors. She usually misquoted or mixed them up in an\nendearing sort of way. She was soft-spoken and plain and didn’t wear much\nmakeup. Her graying blond hair was tied up in a bun or stuck under some frumpy\nhat, and she always showed up in a long skirt and loose knit sweater like some\nold hippie chick. She looked like the grown-up version of Annie Hall. \n\n\n\nJennifer was one\nof the oldest members of the club and the main topic of conversation during our\nbreaks. No one was certain whether she had had SRS or not, but everyone held\nher in high esteem. We all knew her intentions were good. Besides, Canon Jones,\nand one of the former members who presided over my first meeting before leaving\nto parts unknown, she was one of the few people that appeared to care about our\nprogress and tried to be comforting. \n\n\n\nShe used to be an\nengineer at a big firm in Manhattan until she walked into the office one day\nwith her thinning blond hair tied back in a bun behind her head and in a long,\nknit skirt and cowl-neck sweater. Her partners called her into the boardroom\nand offered her an early retirement package she could not refuse. \n\n\n\nWhen she was not\nrunning our meetings or arguing with her live-in girlfriend Julie, she stayed\nhome by a phone in her anteroom waiting for a call from her son. Gossip had it,\nwhen Jennifer’s ex-wife informed the boy what was going on with his father, he\nnever returned home from Penn State. \n\n\n\nThe greatest part\nof the gossip however was Julie, an ex-priest. She was a bit disconcerting to\nbe around. It was bad enough for most to descend into the bowels of a church\ndressed in ways that could get you arrested in the 1990’s and share intimate\nsecrets with complete strangers but she made it even more uncomfortable. \n\n\n\nJulie was that\nnun from Hell, the one who dragged you out of your seat by the ear and stood\nyou in front of the entire class telling you that your zipper was open and\nforbade you to look down to see if it really was. Not only did her outfit\nresemble the Carmelite nuns that taught me for the first eight years of my\nacademic life, her mannerisms reminded me of my Seventh-grade teacher, Sister\nAloysius, right down to the nervous tic of her mouth whenever she scolded you\nfor slouching in your chair. \n\n\n\nWith the\nexception of Julie’s starched blouse that was usually\npetrified-white, she wore black like a second skin. Black dress, black sweater,\nblack-framed glasses, and her black hair tied back with a black ribbon. She\nwore black nun-shoes—the kind with a thick heel and blunt toe. Julie and\nJennifer lived together in Jennifer’s large stately home off King’s Highway in\nan old established neighborhood in Bridgeport. \n\n\n\nJulie was still on the books as the club vice\npresident but seldom showed for meetings. When someone inquired, Jennifer would\nsay, “Busy bees must make honey while they can,” or “busy is, busy does.” It\ndidn’t really answer the question but stifled any further inquiry. \n\n\n\nMost were thankful she didn’t come. No one\nwanted to be reminded to keep their legs closed or crossed at the knee if you\nwere wearing a dress or skirt or stopped at some penultimate moment at the\nclimax of a personal story shared with the group for the first time. She would\ntell someone if she thought the subject matter was inappropriate even on breaks\nand no one wanted to be reminded again and again that this was not a place to\nmake “new best friends” simply when you stopped to talk to someone after a meeting.    \n\n\n\nTraci’s boots\nwere on the floor under her chair. Her feet securely tucked up under her while\nshe huddled under her parka with the collar pulled up to her chin. Her breath\nfloated aimlessly up through the loose fabric. She caught me staring and gave\nme the thumbs up. She approved of my casual look—a pair of my daughter Jackie’s\nold jeans hugged my thighs and a long red sweater clung to my budding round\nbosom. If you could pass in androgynous clothing, you had made it. \n\n\n\nTraci said no matter how good we look someone\nalways sees who we once were. Our past creeps through. My eyes narrowed on her\npretty face when she said it. I found it hard to tell the difference between\nher and any of my sisters. She was, without question, as cute as any teenage prom\nqueen. \n\n\n\n“Don’t worry, you’ll get there. Give them\nmoaning whores time to do their magic.” \n\n\n\nThat’s what she called hormones. I was never\nquite sure whether she laughed at my insecurity or her little pundit.\n\n\n\nIt was Traci who convinced me to move in with\nJoe for my year of living in my chosen gender, as required by the program. \n\n\n\n“You can cart each other around from place to\nplace until all your surgeries are complete. No one can go through this alone.”\n\n\n\n\nWhen I asked who assisted her, she just\nsmiled.\n\n\n\nTraci planned on\ngoing deep stealth. She stayed to herself at meetings and avoided interaction\nwith anyone who might give her away. She barely talked to the others except\ncordially. Although not formally appointed, she was my mentor. By the time I\nmoved from Vermont to Hartford, she was halfway through with her ‘year\nof living dangerously’ as she called that time when we strapped our sex up\nbetween our legs and put on a dress, usually for the first time. \n\n\n\nI was fortunate\nshe took me under her wing. I came dressed that first day in blue jeans and\nwork boots looking more like gay Bruce Springsteen than a Lola. I had no\nexperience dressing up as a girl except a few times on Halloween but that ended\nin the sixth grade, after my father told my mother I looked like a squirrel.\nAll I dared wear was a dab of mascara for fear of getting seen by someone I\nknew. \n\n\n\nI had a key to my\nfriend, Frank’s, dental office in Brattleboro. He was never\nthere on weekends and I would stop by to use the bathroom and lightly line my\neyes with a black pencil and fluff out my curly hair with a pick, making my\nandrogynous appearance a little more feminine. But it wasn’t long after the\nhormones kicked in that my friends and people that I have known for years began\ntalking about me in those hushed whispers reserved for folks who claimed to be\nabducted by aliens.\n\n\n\n“Look at those two idiots.” \n\n\n\nTraci jerked her head in the direction of two\nnewbies sitting across from us. She kept her voice low.\n\n\n\n“The tall blonde calls herself Proud Mary. She\nshowed up at the last meeting in a long red dress and a white sweater. A bloody\nmess.” \n\n\n\nTraci had a euphemism for every regular in the\nclub and labeled the newbies if they came back a second time. Whenever she\ncalled me Saint Evelyn my stomach knotted but when she used the epithets that\nshe gave the regulars, I got more nervous. \n\n\n\nBesides Joe, Jennifer and Scary Julie, the ex-priest, there was Sarah the eunuch and Laura the admirer. Cindy was the whiner of the group and Hawk-nose Kaitlyn was the youngest member to regularly attend our meetings. Both she and Cindy were in their late twenties and were rail thin. Traci called them Zeros. I didn’t know it referenced a dress size. I thought she was being derogatory, like all her other labels. \n\n\n\n“Joe calls her Big Kathy,” I said referring to\nthe tall blonde. Traci was unconcerned with what other people thought. I never\nrealized how prejudiced she was towards our own kind.  \n\n\n\n“Like most of these freaks she works in IT and\nis married. Isn’t that Barbie?” \n\n\n\nTraci nodded in the direction of a newbie in a\nwhite dress.\n\n\n\n“No, I don’t think so. She’s Hispanic. Her\neyes are slanted. Barbie had big eyes like the doll, remember. That’s why we\ncalled her that.”\n\n\n\n“Cripes! That’s right. It’s hard to keep track\nof all the freaks. Where do they all come from?” \n\n\n\nJennifer brought\nher finger up to her thin colorless lips. Petite Cindy was in the ‘hot\nseat’ blubbering something about stenosis and an opening the size of a pencil\nnub. She was always crying or feigning emotional trauma to draw sympathy. Her\nlarge dark eyes looked down into her empty lap. Cindy spoke in a\nmonotone-droll-little-girl voice. Her eyes were wide-open and dry. There were\nno tears, but people around her, especially the newbies, feigned empathy as\nthough it was expected of them. \n\n\n\nPeople didn’t\nnormally cry at meetings. Most of our tears were used up long ago as children.\nSelf-pity is unusual for a tranny who survived past puberty. It succumbed to an\nemotional cancer that spread quietly into the trauma of our teen years when we\nnoticed the developing bodies of the girls born in the right body. Pity was\nreplaced by an emptiness and self-loathing before we became adults. \n\n\n\nSome had a chip on their shoulder, but when\nmost first came to the club and realized they were not alone they were elated\nor relieved. No one cried in a meeting unless it was a story about them. How\nshe was molested by a family member or sitting in a warm bath at the age of six\ncontemplating how to cut off the male genitals that did not belong on her body\nwithout bleeding to death.  \n\n\n\nJennifer liked\nCindy for some reason. She often sat in the hot seat. Cindy retold her story\nabout her botched operation by an incompetent Montreal surgeon at almost every\nmeeting. We were the experimental people. Dr. Menard had tried a new spiral\ngrafting procedure to improve on the healing process of the neo-vagina.\nHowever, something went horribly wrong, if you believed Cindy. \n\n\n\n“Cindy is a drama queen,” Traci said. She\nthought Cindy failed to follow directions and insert the prosthetic device into\nthe raw wound twice a day to keep it open until it healed. I pictured the\nlittle girl in The Exorcist stabbing\nher crotch when she said it and winced. Physical pain to pacify our emotional\ntrauma.\n\n\n\n Sarah’s\nhair was cut short like a boy’s but he looked and sounded like a woman because\nhe never went through puberty. He contracted syphilis when he was 9. That’s\nwhen his mother’s boyfriend moved into their trailer. Sarah told me he used to\nsneak into her room at night when her mother passed out from the drugs that he\ngave her. \n\n\n\n“He was a sick man.” \n\n\n\nShe almost\nsounded sorry for him. \n\n\n\nI felt sorry for\nSarah. She didn’t talk much. When she did, it was usually to\ncertain people like me or Laura, who she moved in with when she came up from\nthe New York City. Laura and Sarah were not real members of the XX Club.\nNeither were candidates for sexual reassignment, but Canon Jones let them join\nthe support group whenever they felt like killing themselves.  \n\n\n\nSarah didn’t\nmake eye contact. She usually looked down at her feet when she spoke or at her\nlap if she was sitting. Her voice was low, and you’d have to strain to hear it.\nShe didn’t talk much to the others, but for some reason, she did talk to me. \n\n\n\nEveryone seemed to confide in me and tell me\nthings I did not want to hear, especially Joe. Sometimes people told me too\nmuch—those dirty little secrets that should be locked in a box in the back of a\ncloset or swept under a bed. I kept a smile pressed to my lips and listened and\ntried not to think about how it would affect me. \n\n\n\nFrom meeting to\nmeeting, I barely remembered the ones I saw from the previous month. A handful\nof newbies came and went from time to time, but no one noticed when they didn’t\nshow up again. We were keenly aware that only a handful would make it out alive\nand were relieved when we were still sitting in that imperfect circle of\nchairs. \n\n\n\nOne week several\nnewbies appeared at once. A Konstanz with a “Z” she said,\nthen a Bronwyn, and our hawk-nosed Katlyn paraded in wearing heels and heavy\nmakeup probably for the first time. The more flamboyant monikers revealed a\nchange in attitude among the community as if they were no longer ashamed of\nbeing born odd. They reinvented themselves like children playing in a\nmake-believe world pretending to be something different than they were born—not\nquite a white knight, a soldier, or cowboy but almost always a damsel in\ndistress. \n\n\n\nI didn’t\nknow why anyone would want to be a victim but some of the newbies tended to\nrevel in it like it was their destiny. They came in to challenge the\ngatekeepers, who tried without success to screen them out. The clinic staff\nfound the majority of the support group were these new gender-warriors, many\nalso in need of services. They did not want to change their sex. They\ndisappeared at an alarming rate when they or Canon Jones realized the program\nwas not designed to accommodate them.\n\n\n\nWe turned off\nreality. When someone was missing at the next meeting, we did not ask\nquestions. They could be dead or just decided to revert back to the real world\nand hang up their heels for a while. We never knew. We’d see a newbie sitting\nin a chair where the recently deceased should be and we’d go on acting as\nthough they showed up again—transformed.\n\n\n\nI attended\nseveral meetings, twice a month, while still living at home in Vermont. But as\nthe hormonal therapy progressed, and I began to look and feel differently, I\nknew I had to leave the safety of my home and family if I was to ever become\nthe person, I knew I was meant to be.   \n\n#\n\n\n\n\nShare this:ShareTweetEmailPrintShare on TumblrLike this:Like Loading...\t\n\n\t\n\t\tPosted byFyrecurlSeptember 29, 2019October 4, 2019Posted inExcerpt, Feminist, Gender issues, LGBTQ, Memoir, non-fiction, Trans women, Women and SocietyTags:biography, cultural, diversity, DSM-V, gender dysphoria, Indy writer, Psychology, She-Male, TranssexualLeave a comment on Excerpt From:  The XX Club – a memoir\t\n \n \n\t\n\t\tThe XX Club – a memoir\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\tBy: Michelle Berthiaume\n       *** Soon to be released  ***\nThe 1990s was a dangerous time to go against their Makers design …\n\nShare this:ShareTweetEmailPrintShare on TumblrLike this:Like Loading...\t\n\n\t\n\t\tPosted byFyrecurlSeptember 24, 2019Posted inExcerpt, Gender issues, LGBTQ, Memoir, non-fiction, Sex, Society, Trans women, Women and Society, WritingTags:biography, Books, creative writing, cultural, LGBTQ, novel, trannssexualLeave a comment on The XX Club – a memoir\t\n \n \n\t\n\t\tThe Poet\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\tSpeak to me dear poet,\nlet me hear your gentle voice before the dawn and regret seeps in through the tattered curtains of my life.\nLet your words pour through my weary bones, refresh my soul with your divine,\nI am, for these fine moments before the light, your instrument,\nplay hard until comes the day with all its revelry and spite.\nLeave your mark upon me so all will know that I was yours and you were mine this last beloved night.\nShare this:ShareTweetEmailPrintShare on TumblrLike this:Like Loading...\t\n\n\t\n\t\tPosted byFyrecurlFebruary 3, 2019Posted inDepression, Love, Poetry, Romance, WritingTags:aging, art, creative writing, death, Free Verse, heartbreak, Love, Poetry, women, WritingLeave a comment on The Poet\t\n \n \n\t\n\t\tThe Poet\t\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\nSpeak to me dear poet,\nlet me hear your gentle voice before the dawn and regret seeps in through the tattered curtains of my life.\nLet your words pour through my weary bones, refresh my soul with your divine,\nI am, for these fine moments before the light, your instrument,\nplay hard until comes the day with all its revelry and spite.\nLeave your mark upon me so all will know that I was yours and you were mine this last beloved night.\nShare this:ShareTweetEmailPrintShare on TumblrLike this:Like Loading...\t\n\n\t\n\t\tPosted byFyrecurlJanuary 31, 2019July 3, 2019Posted inWomen and SocietyLeave a comment on The Poet\t\n \n \n\t\n\t\tTHE SEVENTH DAUGHTER\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\nA Daughter is a rose without thorns . . . – Emily Michelle McNamee\n\n\n\n___________\n\n\n\nWhen he died, Da was only forty-five. They lied to Ma and said he fell off his horse. I knew it was not the fall that killed him. Not that a games-keeper for the Kings’ estate in County Cork could not fall off his horse. I’d seen Da do it after a visit to Killian’s Pub but I’d seen the leaves on the morn of his death and knew. The lord of the manor had come all the way from England for the annual hunt. He come into the kitchen and had me do his reading when Da was outside hitching up the wagon. I curtsied and told him: “Nah, Sir, I am forbade to read the leaves. If Father McGinnis finds out, there’d be the devil to pay.” Lord Kensington laughed.\n\n\n\n“It’s not for real, Lass. It’s for entertainment.” Although I was barely eleven, my skills with alchemy and other gifts were legendary among the Baile. “Come now. Let’s see what ya can do. You are the seventh daughter of the seventh daughter, are you not?”\n\n\n\nI nodded and fetched the pot from the stove and prepared his cup. I no sooner poured the water over the dried leaves and the chill fell upon me. I shuddered. He laughed and helped me steady the pot back onto the stove. His hands stayed on my shoulders and slid down to cover my hands. They were soft for a man. Not a callous or scar on them. he twirled me around as if to study me. Then of a sudden he let go and sat back down. His eyes bade me to go on. \n\n\n\nWhen he was through his breakfast including the tea I poured him he put his cup on the table, sat back and bade me to sit upon his lap. My sisters stood in the corner staring at their shoes. As lord of the manor our whole family were his servants. None dare deny his command. I stared into the bottom of the empty cup staring at the pattern the leaves had formed. when they all had seemed to settle into place, it presented itself in Olde English, a language of his ancestors that I was least familiar. As a daughter of the head games-keeper, I had learned all manner of things beyond my station to assist the ladies of the men who came to the manor for the hunt. From the various guests I learned French, Welch, Gaelic, and some Olde English. It was the hardest to learn, taught me by the Lord’s spinster sister, Cecile, who used to accompany him in the years when she could ride. \n\n\n\n“Well, girl, hurry up. I don’t have all day. We got game to catch.” My sisters snickered nervously from the corner by the stove and his man, Charles, who tended to his personal needs, stood somberly to one side holding his boots. \n\n\n\n“It’s hard, Sir. It’s in a difficult tongue. I have to wait for the images to form in me brain. You have a different linage. I—” I stopped suddenly when it came to me as if spoken into my ear by some faerie passing through. “A man will die on the hunt this day,” I cried in a voice much too old for me and that vibrated as if more than one person was speaking from far away. I pulled away from his grasp. Startled by my outburst, he let go of me and I landed on the floor on the pads of my feet. He held the table to steady himself as he stood. Perhaps he thought I meant him. \n\n\n\n“Nonsense, girl.” He shouted. “You disappoint me.” I saw his blue eyes widen before he ran out the back door in his stocking feet with Charles chasing after him. I ran out the front where I knew Da was waiting with the wagon. It was his job to show the Lord and his party where the beasts would be hiding and carry back the prizes of the day in his wagon. \n\n\n\n“Da, don’t go!” I screamed. Dark clouds were already forming on the horizon above the gables. \n\n\n\n“Katie, calm down. We’ll be back ‘afore the sun falls. Tell your mother to prepare stock for venison.” He was laughing at me. I nearly took a fall. “It’s a fine day. Cernunnos smiles upon the McNamee. A big white on the mountain goin’ a fall. I know—”\n\n\n\n“The stag is in the heather, not on the hill and ’tis an omen, Da.” I finish for him. It got his attention. I’d broke my promise. He knew. His face turned ashen then red. \n\n\n\n“Katie, go back inside. I’ll deal with ya when I return.”\n\n\n\n“No, don’t go.”  \n\n\n\n“Katie!” He raised the whip in his hand then clutched his chest with the other. I ran back inside to tell Ma. But it was too late. Pa was already chasing his big white stag in the heather.\n\n\n\nIt was dusk when the horn sounded and the hunt was over. I sat stone still on the swing on the back porch. I hovered, bare feet dangling over the edge, looking out over the heather, a Norse wind teasing the ends of my skirts then it lifted me. I am on the wagon beside my Da. We sit in silence looking down across the spotted back of Martha, feeling the warmth of the late afternoon sun on our faces as she trots down the lane toward home. He looks happy to see me. All my witchery forgotten. He looks to the sea toward Neamh. His old eyes smiling. He squeezes me hand and together we begin: “And I’d give the world if she could sing, that song to me this day.” \n\n\n\n \nShare this:ShareTweetEmailPrintShare on TumblrLike this:Like Loading...\t\n\n\t\n\t\tPosted byFyrecurlDecember 14, 2018January 11, 2020Posted inFamily, Fiction, Memoir, Women and Society, WritingTags:art, Books, creative writing, daughters, flash fiction; short story;, Inspiration, literature, womenLeave a comment on THE SEVENTH DAUGHTER\t\n \n \n\t\n\t\tJen Rose\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\tHer name is Jen Rose. She is my daughter and I have learned a lot from her on how to be an  empowered woman in an ever-changing world. Even as a child her inner strength and compassion radiated to everyone around her. Somehow she managed to rise up from being a petite introverted girl to become the hero others, boys and girls alike, admired and strove to emulate. Granted, her ubringing was not conventional. The Airforce moved us around the country when she was small but prior to starting school we settled down in a small town in Central Vermont where they had a progressive school system. She began playing sports,  particularly soccer, since she was first able to walk. I coached her and her younger sister, Jaq, and dozens of other children in a youth sports program designed to introduce, the then foreign sport, to a city that prided itself on it’s hockey, football and baseball championship teams. By the time Jen Rose was in seventh grade she was playing softball, basketball, bowling, track and soccer nearly year round along with her baby sister and began to gain regional attention. When she broke her leg in a soccer match shortly before basketball season she asked the doctor for a walking cast so she could keep active. I don’t think the doctor anticipated she would be clip-clipping up and down a court in front of cheering crowds to help her team to victory. A week after the cast came off she called me on the telephone and told me had assembled the first ever girls’s team to compete in a summer soccer league and then informed me that I was the coach. That summer both Jaq and Jen Rose were scouted and picked up by an international girls youth soccer team from the state’s largest city. We traveled to Canada where both Jen Rose and Jaq distinguished themselves as two of the state’s premiere players to contend with. Jen at midfield and Jaq, who had shot up to be the tallest girl in her class, as goalie. The area newspapers adored Jen Rose and covered her extensively as she progressed. She was hailed as the best female athlete to hit Central Vermont and filled a scrap book of clippings more than an inch thick. Despite all of the adoration she never let it go to head and always praised the other players on her teams. She managed to keep up her grades to remain in the top third academically in her class and in her senior year she wrote, directed, acted and choreographed the Senior school production of Let’s Put on a Play with her sister, Jaq,  in the lead role. That same year she and her sisters bowling team won the state finals. Immediately after the last ball rolled down the lane, we drove 2 hours to Smith College in Massachusetts so that she could compete in the regional track meet. She took third in the 440 meter race.  The day that Coach Ventriglia called to inform her that she had a position on the Lady Knights, West Points’ prestigious women’s soccer team, Jen Rose, and her little sister, Jaq, played in a match that would culminate their illustrious athletic careers at Spalding Regional High school. With several broken meta tarsals in both feet, in double over time and with one player down, Jen  came out of sweeper position to rush down the field to score the winning goal against a team that hadn’t lost a game in three consequetive seasons. The papers credited the win to her and “Jen’s little sister”. Jaq earned the title of “spider woman” for the countless spectacular saves in net. That Spring, Jaq, requested she play on a separate softball team citing she as tired of being referred to as: Jen’s Little sister.  As fate would have it the two teams were pitted against each other in the softball state finals with the winner representing Vermont in the regional at Amherst. Jen’s team went to the regional tournament. She weathered her Parents divorce the breakup of her family and the trials and tribulations of being one of the few female cadets at USMA at West Point during a difficult period and graduated in 1997. She went onto play soccer for the Army winning a gold medal before she hung up her cleats. She served along side her little sister, in many overseas campaigns including Bosnia, Kuwait,  and took over a command in Baghdad before leaving the service to raise her own family.  Although, her athletic and military careers were impressive and as her parent made me proud of her accomplishments. The one thing that will for her stand out in my mind was the time we took her and some of her friends to Ben \u0026 Jerry’s for ice cream. When we were ordering at the counter we discovered she was missing. We frantically ran outside and spotted her across the street assisting an elderly man with his groceries. I am so very proud and grateful to God, she is my daughter. She now has two daughters of her own she raises with her military husband. She put away her scrap book, medals and trophys. Keeping them out of sight, in some drawer of an old dresser and on a shelf collecting dust in the back of her closet, where they can do no harm. She is trying not to influence her daughters or make them feel they must compete or follow in her wake. When I tell them their mother was a superstar they look at me and smile as though I’ve told them some fairy tale. To them, she is a Wonder Woman because she’s: Mom. \nShare this:ShareTweetEmailPrintShare on TumblrLike this:Like Loading...\t\n\n\t\n\t\tPosted byFyrecurlDecember 14, 2018December 14, 2018Posted inExcerpt, Family, feminism, Gender issues, kids, Memoir, Mothers, Parenting, Society, Women and SocietyTags:daughters, Family, ParentsLeave a comment on Jen Rose\t\n \n \n\t\n\t\tThe View\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\nA wealthy merchant bought land in a village so he could build a house overlooking a great mountain. He hired a magic elf to construct his home and gave him the plans. When it was finished the man noticed the elf had followed his plans perfectly except there were only two windows both placed side by side facing the mountain. The man confronted the elf and demanded an explanation. “Why did you only put in two windows when I told you I wanted to see the world in all its grandeur!” The elf said: “I followed your instructions. One window is when you wish to see the world as it is. The other is for those days you wake up and see the world as you wish it to be.” Still furious when the elf left he decided to see which window gave him the best view. There were no markings to indicate which was the wishing view. They looked identical and when he looked out he saw the same view of the mountain.\n\n\n\nA week later he saw the elf again on the street and the elf asked him how he liked his view.\n\n\n\nThe man retorted: “Each morning I wake up and go to the window on the left and look out and then the one on the right and see the same mountain. There is no difference.”\n\n\n\n“You’re not wishing hard enough. Go home and give it another try. This time think about the way you would like it to look before openning the curtains,” the elf said then disappeared into the crowded market.\n\n\n\nSo the man went home and this time he thought about the wild flowers he used to see growing on the side of the mountain when he was a boy but when he opened his eyes he saw only the same stark view of the mountain from both windows. Still angry with the elf he went back to the town and when he couldn’t find him he bought a ton of wildflower seeds from a farmer and hired workers to plant them on the side of the mountain.\n\n\n\nIn the Spring he marveled at the sight of the mountain with its splendid colors from all of the wildflowers he had planted but when he looked out of the window on the right the view was the same.\n\n\n\nWhen the man saw the elf on the street that morning he confronted him. “Elf, I did as you instructed but the views from each window are the same.”\n\n\n\n“Tell me, my friend, is the view the same as when I constructed your house?”\n\n\n\nThe wealthy man smiled.\nShare this:ShareTweetEmailPrintShare on TumblrLike this:Like Loading...\t\n\n\t\n\t\tPosted byFyrecurlDecember 14, 2018July 3, 2019Posted inFiction, Prose, Women and Society, WritingTags:flash fiction, perspective, StoryLeave a comment on The View\t\n \n \n\t\n\t\tTranscendence\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\nEach and every night, without fail\nI breach the inky darkness lunging dripping wet,\nI fall beneath the fragile surface of a dream, transcending space and time, without regret,\nSearching and soaring mile after scathing mile, beneath a scarlet moon,\n\n\n\nFalling and melding into the endless void\n\n\n\nto find you …\n\n\n\n\nShare this:ShareTweetEmailPrintShare on TumblrLike this:Like Loading...\t\n\n\t\n\t\tPosted byFyrecurlOctober 30, 2018July 3, 2019Posted inExcerpt, Love, Poetry, Romance, Women and Society, WritingTags:Free Verse, InspirationLeave a comment on Transcendence\t\n \n \n\t\n\t\tCandy Surprise\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\tMOM: Here you can have these chocolate covered nuts if you like.\nMe: “What are they?” I ask, as she pours me a handful.\nMom: IT’S some kind of gormet candy I picked up at the store. supposed to be chocolate covered nuts but taste like coffee.\n\nMe: I thought you liked candy.

We all have them. Some more than others. Addiction, neglect, self-loathing, fears and maladies of all types. They creep into our lives when we least suspect, sometimes right after having a baby and no one fully understand why. Everyone deals with it differently. I use prayer, meditation and exercise to stimulate endorphins in the brain to feel better. Writing or some other form of artistic expression also helps particularly in those darker days with less light. We used to live with layers of generations in one home or close by and the frequent contact of our social circle often made one feel less alone. But alone is how you must face your problem in the final scheme of things bc even those you feel comfort and cherish advice from cannot live your life for you. You have to choose if you want to feel better. No one can do that for you. Find solace in knowing that you have already accomplished much more in your lifetime than many and have friends and family who love you dearly. Take that love and stop feeling you can’t give back a hundredfold of what they give you. A doctor once told me after my first suicide attempt at thirteen, to run and not stop until you can’t. As long as you can keep running, you’ll find something in life worth running to. GOOD luck. Feel better soon.\n\n\n\nAll my love and encouragement,\n\n\n\nFyrecurl\n\n\n\n\nShare this:ShareTweetEmailPrintShare on TumblrLike this:Like Loading...\t\n\n\t\n\t\tPosted byFyrecurlJuly 29, 2018July 3, 2019Posted inWomen and SocietyLeave a comment on When Darkness Comes …\t\n",

  "inline_text": " \n I started this blog in an attempt to start formalising a lot of my ideas and opinions, and develop a stronger focus in my life.  I have many wide-ranging interests, but am now learning that they may be all more closely connected than I ever imagined, and my goal now now is to see what I can turn them all into. \n I currently live on the Sunshine Coast of Australia, with my younger son, and my aging cat.  I am at university full-time, pursuing a  degree in nutrition and dietetics (with a side of exercise science).  I am also a qualified personal trainer. \n I love to cook, especially baking.  I am currently on a mission to eliminate most, if not all, processed foods from my kitchen, and only eat what I have made myself.  I already bake my own bread, but further goals for 2011, include making my own yoghurt and cheese.  However, I am not an extremist, by any means.  If the world did not include red wine and dark chocolate, then it would not be a happy place. \n I also love to sew, although at present, that has been pushed to the side as university has eliminated most of my free time.  I also grow some of my own food, although renting places limitations on that.  But I always have at least herbs and a few salad vegetables. \n My driving passion at present is the importance of food, and the part it plays in our lives (aside from the obvious, as fuel for energy).  I want to learn all I can- from how specific foods function and affect our bodies; to how it is produced and processed; the psychological/cultural relationship we have with food; and how it impacts on the rest of our life. \n looking forward to enjoying your posts!\nsingle mom too [;-)]\nhttp://lesleehare.wordpress.com/\nhttp://allaboutenlightenment.wordpress.com/ \n sorry to be so brief, but it’s 1:30 am here…  cheers! \n I enjoyed reading some of your posts. I found your site through the Post A Day page. I just signed up for that as well. I, too, am trying to live a healthier life and am working towards eating healthier and becoming more fit. I appreciate what you’re writing about and will check back often. It’s nice to know there are others out there working to live healthier too. \n I enjoyed reading some of your posts.

  "inline_text": "\n \n The best way to use SQLite is to embed it in the game using the recommended amalgamation source code available on sqlite.org, but it is also available as a library for Windows (DLL) or Linux (shared-library .so ) . \n From a licensing point of view, using SQLite in any commercial game is also VERY safe since SQLite’s source has been released into the public domain. \n The following steps should allow C++ programmers to embed SQLite into their games. \n  \n Step 1 \n Go to http://www.sqlite.org and click on Download and grab  a file named sqlite-amalgamation-X_X_X.zip where the X’s are replaced by the appropriate version number. In my case I downloaded sqlite-amalgamation-3_7_0.zip (Windows) or sqlite-amalgamation-3.7.0.tar.gz (Linux) \n  \n  \n Step 2Extract the downloaded file and add the sqlite3.h and sqlite3.c files to the project. The size of the sqlite3.c file should be really big, around 3.96MB. \n Step 3Compile sqlite3.c in order to create a object file for it. The object file should be around 1.09MB. \n Step 4Include the sqlite3.h file in the game’s c++ files. For demonstration purposes I created a main.cpp file that looks as follows: \n #include \u003cstdio.h\u003e#include \u003ccstdlib\u003e#include \"sqlite3/sqlite3.h\"#include \u003cstring\u003eusing namespace std;int main(void){sqlite3 *db;char *zErrMsg = 0;int rc;string q = \"\";string dbName = \"game.dat\";//Attempt to open database. If it does not exist create it.rc = sqlite3_open(dbName.c_str(), \u0026db);if( rc ){fprintf(stderr, \"Can't open database: %s\\n\", sqlite3_errmsg(db));sqlite3_close(db);exit(1);}//Set query to executeq = \"\";sqlite3_close(db); //Always close db when done with itreturn 0;} \n Compile and run. There should now be a file called game.dat in the debug directory since SQLite will create the database file by default if it is not found. \n Step 5Since it is now possible to create a database it is time to create some tables. For demonstration purposes I created 2 tables. t_type and t_assets. \n  \n  \n  \n The Types table will simply contain information about various types of assets. The table will consist of an id for identification purposes, a parent id in order to be able to create a tree hierarchy and a title for what type it is, e.g. weapon, vehicle, npc, etc… \n The Assets table will contain information about a specific asset such as an image file or 3d object. The table consist of an id, a type id, src or location of the asset, title or name of the asset and a description.  E.g. Image of a “Toyota Bakkie” that is located at /assests/vehicles/toyota.png with the description:”A Red 4×4 Toyota Bakkie”. \n In order to execute queries on the database the sqlite3_exec function will be used. The code to do that follows: \n //Set query to executeq = \"CREATE TABLE t_type\"\"(\"\"'ID' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\"\"'PARENT_ID' INTEGER,\"\"'TITLE' TEXT\" \");\"\"CREATE TABLE t_assets\"\"(\"\"'ID' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\"\"'TYPE_ID' INTEGER,\"\"'SRC' TEXT,\"\"'TITLE' TEXT,\"\"'DESCRIPTION' TEXT\"\");\";rc = sqlite3_exec(db, q.c_str(), NULL, 0, \u0026zErrMsg);if( rc!=SQLITE_OK ){fprintf(stderr, \"SQL error: %s\\n\", zErrMsg);sqlite3_free(zErrMsg);} \n  \n Note that I do not test whether a table actually exist, maybe you can add that to your code as a bit of an exercise? \n Step 6It is now time to insert some data. The query to do that follows: \n q = \"INSERT INTO t_type('PARENT_ID','TITLE') VALUES (0,'VEHICLES');\"\"INSERT INTO t_type('PARENT_ID','TITLE') VALUES (0,'ANIMALS');\"\"INSERT INTO t_assets('TYPE_ID','SRC','TITLE','DESCRIPTION') VALUES (1,'/assets/vechicles/toyota.png','A Red 4x4 Toyota Bakkie');\"\"INSERT INTO t_assets('TYPE_ID','SRC','TITLE','DESCRIPTION') VALUES (1,'/assets/vechicles/ferrari.png','A twin-turbo F50 Ferrari, like the one John Carmack drives');\"\"INSERT INTO t_assets('TYPE_ID','SRC','TITLE','DESCRIPTION') VALUES (2,'/assets/vechicles/munky.png','A munky. It is a bloody munky');\"; \n  \n You can of course do more advanced stuff like getting the ID of the types and then use that in the query. \n A Fast way to check the data in the file is to open it with notepad or notepad++ to check the results; but I will not recommend that approach with big files. \n Step 7In order to query the data, a callback function needs to be declared. The declaration for that looks as follows: \n static int callback(void*, int, char**, char**); \n  \n  \n This callback function will be called for each row returned from the query. \n The first parameter of this function is not really used.The second parameter contains the number of columns.The third parameter is an array containing the value of each column as a char*.The Fourth and last parameter contains the Names of each column. \n An example callback function follows: \n static int callback(void *NotUsed, int argc, char **argv, char **azColName){int i;for(i=0; i\u003cargc; i++){printf(\"%s = %s\\n\", azColName[i], argv[i] ? argv[i] : \"NULL\");}printf(\"\\n\");return 0;} \n  \n And this is how it will be used: \n q = \"SELECT * FROM t_assets WHERE TYPE_ID=1;\";rc = sqlite3_exec(db, q.c_str(), callback, 0, \u0026zErrMsg);if( rc!=SQLITE_OK ){fprintf(stderr, \"SQL error: %s\\n\", zErrMsg);sqlite3_free(zErrMsg);} \n Expected Output: \n  \n And that is it..The full source code for main.cpp looks as follows: \n  \n #include \u003cstdio.h\u003e#include \u003cconio.h\u003e#include \u003ccstdlib\u003e#include \"sqlite3/sqlite3.h\"#include \u003cstring\u003e \n using namespace std;  \n static int callback(void *NotUsed, int argc, char **argv, char **azColName){   \n  int i;   \n  for(i=0; i\u003cargc; i++){  printf(\"%s = %s\\n\", azColName[i], argv[i] ? argv[i] : \"NULL\");  }   \n  printf(\"\\n\");  return 0;}  \n int main(void){ sqlite3 *db;    char *zErrMsg = 0;    int rc;    string q = \"\";    string dbName = \"game.dat\";      \n  //Attempt to open database.

Είμαστε οι ειδικού στους ηλιακούς θερμοσίφωνες εδώ και 35+ χρόνια. \n Τα ηλιακά συστήματα Fyrogenis είναι σχεδιασμένα να λειτουργούν με πολύ καλή απόδοση όλο το χρόνο, με προϋπόθεση την ηλιοφάνεια 3-4 ωρών μεταξύ 10.00 π.μ. και 15.00 μ.μ. \n Oι επιλεκτικοί συλλέκτες εξασφαλίζουν καταπληκτικές αποδόσεις και το χειμώνα! Εδώ είναι μάλιστα και το σημείο που υπερέχει ο ηλιακός Θερμοσίφωνας Fyrogenis. \n Βασιζόμενοι σε υψηλές προδιαγραφές η FYROGENIS διαθέτει: \n – Μπόιλερ Glass: Θεωρείται η πιο ενδεδειγμένη κατασκευή, κυρίως για τις αντοχές της σε σκληρά νερά και για την υψηλή ελαστικότητά της, \n προστατεύοντας από ρωγμές λόγω συστολής και διαστολής κατά τις απότομες μεταβολές στη θερμοκρασία. \n Συνοδεύεται απο 5 χρόνια Εγγύηση. \n – Μπόιλερ Ανοξείδωτο (ΙΝΟΧ): Δεξαμενή από ανοξείδωτο χάλυβα με μεγάλη αντοχή στη διάβρωση και την ηλεκτρόλυση. Συνοδεύεται από 15 χρόνια Εγγύηση. \n Η συντήρηση ενός ηλιακού συστήματος, όπως εξάλλου όλων των συσκευών και μηχανών, είναι απαραίτητη, ούτως ώστε να εξασφαλιστεί η καλή λειτουργία και η απόδοσή του. \n Κάνοντας service ανά δύο χρόνια , βοηθάμε το σύστημά μας να “αντέξει” στην πάροδο του χρόνου και να μας δίνει ζεστό νερό για περισσότερα χρόνια και με μεγαλύτερη αποτελεσματικότητα. \n Επίσης είναι πολύ σημαντικό να καθαρίζουμε το θερμοδοχείο από τα άλατα και τα βακτήρια που δημιουργούνται από το νερό του δικτύου. \n Το αποτέλεσμα είναι επομένως διπλό: \n α) Οικονομία: καθώς επιμηκύνουμε τη διάρκεια ζωής του προϊόντος και μάλιστα ακόμα πιο αποδοτικά \n β) Υγεία: το ζεστό νερό του μπάνιου και της κουζίνας είναι καθαρό από άλατα, μικρόβια και σκουριές. \n Ηλιακοί Θερμοσίφωνες \n Necessary cookies are absolutely essential for the website to function properly.

Getting to the Nepali coast (it’s namesake) is also a great way to burn frequent flier miles. \n For more details, see the post here: nepali, A Lightweight Nessus Parser \n nepali github repo \n spotPlight automates the process of reading data indexed by Spotlight from a locked macOS device.  The tool was created to exploit (at the time), a relatively quiet data leakage that appeared to at first be fixed, and then vulnerable in subsequent macOS versions.  It was a fun exercise relying heavily on the Linux USB mass storage gadget, automating loopback filesystems and ramdisks. \n For more information on the issue spotPlight exploits, see the post here: macOS Spotlight Data Leakage \n spotPlight github repo \n Cross Site Scripting Anonymous Browser (XAB) leverages sites vulnerable to XSS and client browsers to build a network of drones. It does not replace the current anonymous browsing proxies, but provides an alternative that does not require willing participants. XAB is released as a proof of concept and as a jumping point for further research in the area of Cross Site Scripting. \n The tool and the concept behind it was presented at Blackhat and DEF CON in 2009 by Jeff Yestrumskas and Matt Flick \n XAB github repo \n GuestStealer allows for the stealing of VMware guests from vulnerable hosts based on the Directory Traversal Vulnerability detailed in CVE-2009-3373 and VMSA-2009-0015. GuestStealer was released at ShmooCon during Tony Flick’s ‘Stealing Guests…The VMware Way’ presentation. \n  $ perl gueststealer-v1.1.pl -h 192.168.1.2 -p 8333 -s yes -t server -o /tmp \n Download Gueststealer \n NessusPBE simplifies the process of understanding Nessus output by transforming the data into an actionable format. Specifically, NessusPBE reads in .nbe formatted Nessus reports and creates spreadsheets that can be opened by most office suites, including Microsoft Excel and OpenOffice Spreadsheet. NessusPBE creates three spreadsheets: a list of services identified by Nessus, a list of open ports whose service was not identified by Nessus, and a list of Nessus’ findings. \n Download Nessus PBE \n iNERGy profiles a person’s energy usage by analyzing the energy usage tweets posted to their Twitter account. The tool predicts when the person is home, sleeping, and away from home in order to show how a burglar or stalker could use energy usage information maliciously. iNERGy was released at DEF CON 18 during Tony Flick’s Getting Social with the Smart Grid presentation. \n Download iNERGY \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontact@fyrmassociates.com\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n Copyright 2008-2021 FYRM Associates, Inc. \n \n            \n                    \n                      Services \n                    \n                      \n                        Security Testing\n                      \n                        Compliance \u0026 Risk\n                      \n                        AppTrust Training\n                      \n                    \n                    \n                   \n Security Testing \n Compliance \u0026 Risk \n AppTrust Training \n \n                    \n                    Tools\n                    \n                   \n \n                    \n                    Blog\n                    \n                   \n \n                    \n                    Careers\n                    \n                   \n \n                    \n                    About\n                    \n                   \n \n                    \n                    Contact\n                    \n                   \n Perl \n LWP::Simple Perl module \n XML::Simple Perl module \n Data::Dumper Perl module \n Crypt::SSLeay Perl module",

Είμαστε οι ειδικού στους ηλιακούς θερμοσίφωνες εδώ και 35+ χρόνια. \n   \n Τα ηλιακά συστήματα Fyrogenis είναι σχεδιασμένα να λειτουργούν με πολύ καλή απόδοση όλο το χρόνο, με προϋπόθεση την ηλιοφάνεια 3-4 ωρών μεταξύ 10.00 π.μ. και 15.00 μ.μ. \n Oι επιλεκτικοί συλλέκτες εξασφαλίζουν καταπληκτικές αποδόσεις και το χειμώνα! Εδώ είναι μάλιστα και το σημείο που υπερέχει ο ηλιακός Θερμοσίφωνας Fyrogenis. \n   \n Βασιζόμενοι σε υψηλές προδιαγραφές η FYROGENIS διαθέτει: \n – Μπόιλερ Glass: Θεωρείται η πιο ενδεδειγμένη κατασκευή, κυρίως για τις αντοχές της σε σκληρά νερά και για την υψηλή ελαστικότητά της, \n προστατεύοντας από ρωγμές λόγω συστολής και διαστολής κατά τις απότομες μεταβολές στη θερμοκρασία. \n Συνοδεύεται απο 5 χρόνια Εγγύηση. \n – Μπόιλερ Ανοξείδωτο (ΙΝΟΧ): Δεξαμενή από ανοξείδωτο χάλυβα με μεγάλη αντοχή στη διάβρωση και την ηλεκτρόλυση. Συνοδεύεται από 15 χρόνια Εγγύηση. \n   \n Η συντήρηση ενός ηλιακού συστήματος, όπως εξάλλου όλων των συσκευών και μηχανών, είναι απαραίτητη, ούτως ώστε να εξασφαλιστεί η καλή λειτουργία και η απόδοσή του. \n Κάνοντας service ανά δύο χρόνια , βοηθάμε το σύστημά μας να “αντέξει” στην πάροδο του χρόνου και να μας δίνει ζεστό νερό για περισσότερα χρόνια και με μεγαλύτερη αποτελεσματικότητα. \n Επίσης είναι πολύ σημαντικό να καθαρίζουμε το θερμοδοχείο από τα άλατα και τα βακτήρια που δημιουργούνται από το νερό του δικτύου. \n Το αποτέλεσμα είναι επομένως διπλό: \n α) Οικονομία: καθώς επιμηκύνουμε τη διάρκεια ζωής του προϊόντος και μάλιστα ακόμα πιο αποδοτικά \n β) Υγεία: το ζεστό νερό του μπάνιου και της κουζίνας είναι καθαρό από άλατα, μικρόβια και σκουριές. \n Ηλιακοί Θερμοσίφωνες \n Necessary cookies are absolutely essential for the website to function properly.

  "inline_text": "A fire sand bucket or fire bucket is a mild steel bucket filled with sand which is used to put out fires. Typically, fire buckets are painted bright red and have the word 'Fire' stencilled on them in black lettering. They are placed in prominent positions in rooms or corridors. They are a low-technology method of fighting small fires. The main advantages of fire buckets are that they are cheap, reliable and easy to use. The fire buckets are usually made round bottom so that they cannot be used for other purposes. Fire buckets are hung on fire bucket stands. \n Fire buckets are often kept next to ovens, barbecues, and in government accommodation such as army barrack blocks. They are also commonly found in hyperbaric chambers. Because oil fires are resistant to water, a fire sand bucket is used. In order to extinguish the fire, the sand in the bucket is dumped on the fire to starve it of the oxygen it needs to stay alight. This method of fighting liquid fires has generally been replaced by modern foaming agents. \n The sand from a fire bucket can also be used to absorb spills of flammable liquids and render them less dangerous, by reducing the risk of ignition and explosion. Fire buckets are often provided at petrol filling stations to absorb any small fuel spills. \n Fire extinguisher brackets are designed to serve such purpose. These brackets are used to install fire extinguishers and keep them in place. These devices can keep the extinguishers from being knocked down or moved to another place. \n A fire blanket is a safety device designed to extinguish small incipient (starting) fires. It consists of a sheet of fire retardant material which is placed over a fire in order to smother it. \n Small fire blankets such as, for use in kitchens and around the home, are usually made of fibreglass, and are folded in to a quick-release container for ease of storage. \n Larger fire blankets, for use in laboratory and industrial situations, are often made of wool (sometimes treated with a flame retardant fluid). These blankets are usually mounted in vertical quick-release cabinets so that they can be easily pulled out and wrapped round a person whose clothes are on fire.\n              Home\n             \n \n              Profile\n             \n \n              Products\n              \n                \n                  \n                    Fire Extinguishers\n                    Fire Equipments\n                    Fire Alarm System\n                    Fire Hydrant System\n                    Sprinkler\n                    Signages\n                  \n                \n              \n             \n Fire Extinguishers \n Fire Equipments \n Fire Alarm System \n Fire Hydrant System \n Sprinkler \n Signages \n \n              Services\n             \n \n              Clients\n             \n \n              Contact Us\n             \n  No damage to walls. \n  Ideal where walls are unstable or dry lined. \n  Easily re-positioned to accommodate changing office layout. \n  Available in red.",

We had great conversations about what hacking actually happens at DEF CON, what kind of hacking can be expected, and we think there is enough evidence to at least partially answer that question. \n Continue reading\n                                     \n \n                                          \n                                          By Matt Flick\n                                          \n                                          \n                                          \n                                          in Application Security\n                                          \n                                          \n\n                                         \n Integrating Compliance Auditing with DevSecOps By now you have probably at least read about the benefits of merging development, security, and operations into a cohesive unit (if not also implemented to some degree). Now it’s time to take it a little further: integrating security compliance audits. Whether you face mandated audits, like PCI, FISMA and agency specific implementations like Security Controls Testing (SCA) or NISTIR 8011 flavored Adaptive Capabilities Testing (ACT), or self-imposed assessments for your own [good] reasons (or both), integrating an external audit with your system development and maintenance process can help your organization more efficiently remediate vulnerabilities and weaknesses, and the overall audit process will be less costly. \n Continue reading\n                                     \n \n                                          \n                                          By Jeff Yestrumskas\n                                          \n                                          \n                                          \n                                          in DEF CON\n                                          \n                                          \n\n                                         \n Table of Contents  Background Inspiration Features Design Hardware Software Programming Photos Videos Conclusion   Last Updated: 2019-10-10 This post is part 1 of 2.

Sometimes you want something quick and easy. Hence we wrote a quick little python script that parses one or more .nessus files and produces a spreadsheet (Excel format).

The goal is to identify all the in scope assets and data exposures, as the more coverage we attain of a target environment the more thorough we can be with our penetration testing. This information can include things like ip addresses, subdomains, code repositories, employee data or anything that tells us more about the company and introduces a crack in the external defenses. \n Continue reading\n                                     \n \n                                          \n                                          By Jeff Yestrumskas, Nate Robb\n                                          \n                                          \n                                          \n                                          in Tools\n                                          \n                                          \n\n                                         \n For a period of time, it was possible to read snippets of memory on a screen-locked mac OS system from the USB port.\nA while back we noticed some interesting files created by macOS when inserting a USB drive.

  "inline_text": "Välkommen till fyrk.fi som hjälper dig navigera bland stipendier och understöd. Här hittar du information om privata fonder och stiftelser, statliga och regionala understöd, samt nordiska stödformer och EU-finansiering.  \n  \nPå startsidan är bidragskällorna listade kronologiskt enligt ansökningstid. Du kan göra en textsökning i sökfältet, eller klicka på länken “Filter” och söka fram bidragskällor med hjälp av sökord. Här kan du också välja att lista de bidragskällor som har fortlöpande eller varierande ansökningstider, de som annars är listade efter bidragskällorna med en ett exakt datum. I sökresultaten listas endast de bidragskällor som har en ansökningstid i framtiden definierad.  \n \nInformationen i fyrk.fi uppdateras kontinuerligt av personalen i Luckan.  Fr.o.m. senhösten 2013 ges alla bidragskällor möjligheten att själva uppdatera sin information i fyrk.fi.  \n  \n \n\nTipsa oss gärna om bidragskällor som inte syns i sökresultaten.  \n \n\nAnsökningstiderna i sökresultaten kan vara preliminära/riktgivande. Kontrollera ALLTID ansökningstiderna på bidragskällans hemsida.  \n \n\nFörfrågningar rörande Fyrk.fi görs till Karl Norrbom, e-post: [email protected]  \n \n\nDen första versionen av Fyrk.fi versionen lanserades av Luckan i Helsingfors år 2003, med finansiering från Svenska kulturfonden, som också stöder utformningen av den här nya versionen. Nya Fyrk.fi har också ingått i ett projekt som finansierades av Nylands Förbund. I projektet kartlade vi kommuners intresse i östra Nyland att använda Fyrk.fi som plattform för att informera om kommunala stipendier och understöd. \n \n Välkommen till ProjektProffs - ett stödverktyg för projektaktörer. Använd ProjektProffs när du vill utveckla ditt projektkunnande och öka din konkurrenskraft vid sökandet av externa projektmedel. \n \nInnehållet i ProjektProffs har skapats av PDGE Oy och Kreativa delaktiga Finland synliggör materialet på fyrk.fi i samarbete med Svenska kulturfonden. \n Planera projektet och skriv en projektplan först!Planera realistiskt och låt inte finansieringsmöjligheter styra era genuina målsättningar! \n Viktiga punkter:  \n Diskutera med finansiären för att få en bild av vad man ger bidrag till och om det är något speciellt ni bör tänka på. Läs noga igenom den allmänna beskrivningen för bidraget, fonden eller annan finansiering. Se till att ni är behöriga att söka, om det är tveksamt bör ni hellre undvika att söka och koncentrera er på de möjligheter som ni verkligen har en chans på.  Sortera de olika ansökningar ni har hittat i den ordning ni skulle vilja ha dem. Ni måste själv kontrollera om ni uppfyller alla krav som ställs. Var sanningsenlig och realistisk. När ni gjort ert urval av så sätter ni upp dessa på en lista i efter sista ansökningsdag.Oavsett om du ska söka en liten summa pengar eller satsa på ett större projekt så är bidragsgivare intresserade av vad du ska använda pengarna till. Se skrivandet av ansökan som en bra chans att fundera igenom alla delar av projektet. Det mesta arbetet i ett projekt ligger ofta i förberedelsefasen och genom att formulera tankarna på papper så märker man ofta vad man behöver fundera mer på eller om man inom gruppen inte är överens om vad det är man vill göra.Att skriva projektplan och därefter ansökningar tar en del tid men ju mer tid ni lägger ner på att fundera ut hur ni vill ha ert projekt, desto mer tid och kraft kommer ni att spara när ni väl sätter igång.1.1 Välkommen \n 2.1 Vad är LFA-metoden? \n 3.1 Innan du börjar skriva på ansökan \n 4.1 Nationella bidrag, stiftelser och fonder \n 5.1 Mål- och resultatstyrning \n 6.1 Uppföljning och utvärdering \n 7 Materialbank \n 3.1 Innan du börjar skriva på ansökan \n 3.2 När du skriver ansökan \n Var ute i god tid! Att söka bidrag är en tidskrävande process. \n Ta reda på sista ansökningsdag. \n Ta reda på datum för beslut och om man skickar ut besked. \n Ta reda på vilka särskilda blanketter krävs och skaffa dem i god tid. \n Undersök om du behöver skicka med bilagor, till exempel årsberättelser från tidigare år. Det kan  t.ex. behövas namnteckningar och då är det bra att inte behöva jaga reda på dem sista kvällen.",

  "inline_text": "\n \n The Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor published the annual report on the situation with the respect of religious freedom in the FYR Macedonia in the course of 2006. \n There is an impression that the greater art of the report has been dedicated to the denial of religious freedom to the citizens, members of the Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric.  \n http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71394.htm \n FYR. Macedonia has religious prisoners. \n The report deals with the imprisonment of His Beatitude, the Archbishop of Ohrid and Metropolitan of Skopje, k. k. Jovan implying that with the decision of the Supreme Court from February 2006, his prison sentence was reduced “which led to his release from prison, after which there were no cases of religious or political prisoners in the country”. We remind you that the Archbishop k. k. Jovan, after two releasing verdicts, has once again been put in prison, and the Macedonian Orthodox Church has once again filed a complaint against the liberating verdict reached regarding a third charge raised against him. The indicated proverbial corruption of the Macedonian judiciary is not subject to comment in this observation . \n   \n http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71394.htm \n According to the newest report of the Venice Commission, yet there are disputable items in the draft law of religious communities, especially at the point – registering religious communities. This report will be a subject of the following text. \n The Government of the FYR Macedonia, which protects the monopoly of the Macedonian Orthodox Church, is sacrificing the European future of the citizens. Critics point out the Government is only declaratively ready for reforms, while practically the reforms in terms of religious freedoms are tending to be evaded. \n At the same time, with the critics, in terms violating religious freedoms in the FYR Macedonia by the International Community, the Fund “Archbishop Jovan” from the United States of America has issued its newest \n  \n  'Criminally responsible'  \n  Mr Boskovski, 46, was alleged to have effective command and control over the forces from his position as interior minister.   \n         \n  \n  \"Due to his failure to take necessary and reasonable measures to punish the perpetrators of the crimes committed in the village of Ljuboten, the prosecution will ask you to find Ljube Boskovski criminally responsible as a superior,\" prosecutor Dan Saxon said.  \n  Prosecutors say Mr Tarculovski, 32, ran a private security unit loyal to Mr Boskovski and led the attack on the village. \n  \n There is support for Mr Boskovski in FYR MacedoniaSite against the imprisonment of Arch Bishop Jovan \n \n\n\n\n        ▼ \n      \n\n\n\n2010\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n        ▼ \n      \n\n\n\nMarch\n\n(1)\n\nViolations of Human Rights of Macedonian Citizens ...\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n        ▼ \n      \n\n\n\nMarch\n\n(1)\n\nViolations of Human Rights of Macedonian Citizens ...\n\n \n Violations of Human Rights of Macedonian Citizens ... \n \n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\n2008\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\nMarch\n\n(1)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\nMarch\n\n(1)\n \n \n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\n2007\n\n(7)\n\n\n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\nJuly\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\nJune\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\nMay\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\nFebruary\n\n(1)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\nJuly\n\n(3)\n \n \n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\nJune\n\n(1)\n \n \n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\nMay\n\n(2)\n \n \n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\nFebruary\n\n(1)\n",

  "inline_text": "Welcome to the Lafayette intellectual community. Before you embark on your journey it is important that we find out about you and your previous educational experience.  \n Let’s Begin your Placement Exams: \n   \n As a Lafayette Student you are required to complete a placement exam in Mathematics. \n • If you plan to take Chinese (Mandarin), French, German, or Spanish at Lafayette and you have prior knowledge of the subject (that is, you are not a true beginner), you are required to submit a subject test score.

If you want to see my TBR list sorted another way – i.e. by author – you can visit it at my LibraryThing catalog. \n Books that I have cleared from my TBR pile are crossed out. If there is a plus sign in front of the listing, clicking on the link will take you to my review at LibraryThing; otherwise, the link will take you to my review on this blog. \n Note that these are not all of my reviews – audiobooks I’ve listened to, as well as books I read but didn’t own aren’t included here.

  "inline_text": "\n \n The best way to use SQLite is to embed it in the game using the recommended amalgamation source code available on sqlite.org, but it is also available as a library for Windows (DLL) or Linux (shared-library .so ) . \n From a licensing point of view, using SQLite in any commercial game is also VERY safe since SQLite’s source has been released into the public domain. \n The following steps should allow C++ programmers to embed SQLite into their games. \n  \n Step 1 \n Go to http://www.sqlite.org and click on Download and grab  a file named sqlite-amalgamation-X_X_X.zip where the X’s are replaced by the appropriate version number. In my case I downloaded sqlite-amalgamation-3_7_0.zip (Windows) or sqlite-amalgamation-3.7.0.tar.gz (Linux) \n  \n  \n Step 2Extract the downloaded file and add the sqlite3.h and sqlite3.c files to the project. The size of the sqlite3.c file should be really big, around 3.96MB. \n Step 3Compile sqlite3.c in order to create a object file for it. The object file should be around 1.09MB. \n Step 4Include the sqlite3.h file in the game’s c++ files. For demonstration purposes I created a main.cpp file that looks as follows: \n #include \u003cstdio.h\u003e#include \u003ccstdlib\u003e#include \"sqlite3/sqlite3.h\"#include \u003cstring\u003eusing namespace std;int main(void){sqlite3 *db;char *zErrMsg = 0;int rc;string q = \"\";string dbName = \"game.dat\";//Attempt to open database. If it does not exist create it.rc = sqlite3_open(dbName.c_str(), \u0026db);if( rc ){fprintf(stderr, \"Can't open database: %s\\n\", sqlite3_errmsg(db));sqlite3_close(db);exit(1);}//Set query to executeq = \"\";sqlite3_close(db); //Always close db when done with itreturn 0;} \n Compile and run. There should now be a file called game.dat in the debug directory since SQLite will create the database file by default if it is not found. \n Step 5Since it is now possible to create a database it is time to create some tables. For demonstration purposes I created 2 tables. t_type and t_assets. \n  \n  \n  \n The Types table will simply contain information about various types of assets. The table will consist of an id for identification purposes, a parent id in order to be able to create a tree hierarchy and a title for what type it is, e.g. weapon, vehicle, npc, etc… \n The Assets table will contain information about a specific asset such as an image file or 3d object. The table consist of an id, a type id, src or location of the asset, title or name of the asset and a description.  E.g. Image of a “Toyota Bakkie” that is located at /assests/vehicles/toyota.png with the description:”A Red 4×4 Toyota Bakkie”. \n In order to execute queries on the database the sqlite3_exec function will be used. The code to do that follows: \n //Set query to executeq = \"CREATE TABLE t_type\"\"(\"\"'ID' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\"\"'PARENT_ID' INTEGER,\"\"'TITLE' TEXT\" \");\"\"CREATE TABLE t_assets\"\"(\"\"'ID' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\"\"'TYPE_ID' INTEGER,\"\"'SRC' TEXT,\"\"'TITLE' TEXT,\"\"'DESCRIPTION' TEXT\"\");\";rc = sqlite3_exec(db, q.c_str(), NULL, 0, \u0026zErrMsg);if( rc!=SQLITE_OK ){fprintf(stderr, \"SQL error: %s\\n\", zErrMsg);sqlite3_free(zErrMsg);} \n  \n Note that I do not test whether a table actually exist, maybe you can add that to your code as a bit of an exercise? \n Step 6It is now time to insert some data. The query to do that follows: \n q = \"INSERT INTO t_type('PARENT_ID','TITLE') VALUES (0,'VEHICLES');\"\"INSERT INTO t_type('PARENT_ID','TITLE') VALUES (0,'ANIMALS');\"\"INSERT INTO t_assets('TYPE_ID','SRC','TITLE','DESCRIPTION') VALUES (1,'/assets/vechicles/toyota.png','A Red 4x4 Toyota Bakkie');\"\"INSERT INTO t_assets('TYPE_ID','SRC','TITLE','DESCRIPTION') VALUES (1,'/assets/vechicles/ferrari.png','A twin-turbo F50 Ferrari, like the one John Carmack drives');\"\"INSERT INTO t_assets('TYPE_ID','SRC','TITLE','DESCRIPTION') VALUES (2,'/assets/vechicles/munky.png','A munky. It is a bloody munky');\"; \n  \n You can of course do more advanced stuff like getting the ID of the types and then use that in the query. \n A Fast way to check the data in the file is to open it with notepad or notepad++ to check the results; but I will not recommend that approach with big files. \n Step 7In order to query the data, a callback function needs to be declared. The declaration for that looks as follows: \n static int callback(void*, int, char**, char**); \n  \n  \n This callback function will be called for each row returned from the query. \n The first parameter of this function is not really used.The second parameter contains the number of columns.The third parameter is an array containing the value of each column as a char*.The Fourth and last parameter contains the Names of each column. \n An example callback function follows: \n static int callback(void *NotUsed, int argc, char **argv, char **azColName){int i;for(i=0; i\u003cargc; i++){printf(\"%s = %s\\n\", azColName[i], argv[i] ? argv[i] : \"NULL\");}printf(\"\\n\");return 0;} \n  \n And this is how it will be used: \n q = \"SELECT * FROM t_assets WHERE TYPE_ID=1;\";rc = sqlite3_exec(db, q.c_str(), callback, 0, \u0026zErrMsg);if( rc!=SQLITE_OK ){fprintf(stderr, \"SQL error: %s\\n\", zErrMsg);sqlite3_free(zErrMsg);} \n Expected Output: \n  \n And that is it..The full source code for main.cpp looks as follows: \n  \n #include \u003cstdio.h\u003e#include \u003cconio.h\u003e#include \u003ccstdlib\u003e#include \"sqlite3/sqlite3.h\"#include \u003cstring\u003e \n using namespace std;  \n static int callback(void *NotUsed, int argc, char **argv, char **azColName){   \n  int i;   \n  for(i=0; i\u003cargc; i++){  printf(\"%s = %s\\n\", azColName[i], argv[i] ? argv[i] : \"NULL\");  }   \n  printf(\"\\n\");  return 0;}  \n int main(void){ sqlite3 *db;    char *zErrMsg = 0;    int rc;    string q = \"\";    string dbName = \"game.dat\";      \n  //Attempt to open database. If it does not exist create it.    rc = sqlite3_open(dbName.c_str(), \u0026db);      \n  if( rc ){  fprintf(stderr, \"Can't open database: %s\\n\", sqlite3_errmsg(db));  sqlite3_close(db);  exit(1);    }      \n  //Set query to execute    q = \"CREATE TABLE t_type\" \"(\" \"'ID' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\" \"'PARENT_ID' INTEGER KEY,\" \"'TITLE' TEXT\" \");\" \"CREATE TABLE t_assets\" \"(\" \"'ID' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\" \"'TYPE_ID' INTEGER KEY,\" \"'SRC' TEXT,\" \"'TITLE' TEXT,\" \"'DESCRIPTION' TEXT\" \");\";      \n  rc = sqlite3_exec(db, q.c_str(), NULL, 0, \u0026zErrMsg); if( rc!=SQLITE_OK ){  fprintf(stderr, \"SQL error: %s\\n\", zErrMsg);  sqlite3_free(zErrMsg);      }      \n  q = \"INSERT INTO t_type('PARENT_ID','TITLE') VALUES (0,'VEHICLES');\" \"INSERT INTO t_type('PARENT_ID','TITLE') VALUES (0,'ANIMALS');\" \"INSERT INTO t_assets('TYPE_ID','SRC','TITLE','DESCRIPTION') VALUES (1,'/assets/vechicles/toyota.png','Toyota Bakkie','A Red 4x4 Toyota Bakkie');\" \"INSERT INTO t_assets('TYPE_ID','SRC','TITLE','DESCRIPTION') VALUES (1,'/assets/vechicles/ferrari.png','Ferrari','A twin-turbo F50 Ferrari, like the one John Carmack drives');\" \"INSERT INTO t_assets('TYPE_ID','SRC','TITLE','DESCRIPTION') VALUES (2,'/assets/vechicles/munky.png','Munky','A munky.

E.g. \n $createdate =\u0026 JFactory::getDate(time()); \n Note that you wil override the date everytime you save to the database. See if you can modify the model to set the create date only on new saves. :) \n  \n http://api.joomla.org/Joomla-Framework/Utilities/JDate.html \n \u003c?php$db = \u0026JFactory::getDBO();$query = \"SELECT `id`,`name` FROM#__town\";$db-\u003esetQuery($query);$townlist = $db-\u003eloadObjectList();  \n /*Create an instance of MySelectObject*/$mso = new MySelectObject(); \n /*Set values*/$mso-\u003eid = 0;$mso-\u003ename = 'Any Town';  \n /*Create an array for insertion*/$tmpArr = array(0 =\u003e $mso);  \n /*Merge with array result from query.

  "inline_text": "Välkommen till fyrk.fi som hjälper dig navigera bland stipendier och understöd. Här hittar du information om privata fonder och stiftelser, statliga och regionala understöd, samt nordiska stödformer och EU-finansiering.  \n  \nPå startsidan är bidragskällorna listade kronologiskt enligt ansökningstid. Du kan göra en textsökning i sökfältet, eller klicka på länken “Filter” och söka fram bidragskällor med hjälp av sökord. Här kan du också välja att lista de bidragskällor som har fortlöpande eller varierande ansökningstider, de som annars är listade efter bidragskällorna med en ett exakt datum. I sökresultaten listas endast de bidragskällor som har en ansökningstid i framtiden definierad.  \n \nInformationen i fyrk.fi uppdateras kontinuerligt av personalen i Luckan.  Fr.o.m. senhösten 2013 ges alla bidragskällor möjligheten att själva uppdatera sin information i fyrk.fi.  \n  \n \n\nTipsa oss gärna om bidragskällor som inte syns i sökresultaten.  \n \n\nAnsökningstiderna i sökresultaten kan vara preliminära/riktgivande. Kontrollera ALLTID ansökningstiderna på bidragskällans hemsida.  \n \n\nFörfrågningar rörande Fyrk.fi görs till Karl Norrbom, e-post: [email protected]  \n \n\nDen första versionen av Fyrk.fi versionen lanserades av Luckan i Helsingfors år 2003, med finansiering från Svenska kulturfonden, som också stöder utformningen av den här nya versionen. Nya Fyrk.fi har också ingått i ett projekt som finansierades av Nylands Förbund. I projektet kartlade vi kommuners intresse i östra Nyland att använda Fyrk.fi som plattform för att informera om kommunala stipendier och understöd. \n \n Välkommen till ProjektProffs - ett stödverktyg för projektaktörer. Använd ProjektProffs när du vill utveckla ditt projektkunnande och öka din konkurrenskraft vid sökandet av externa projektmedel. \n \nInnehållet i ProjektProffs har skapats av PDGE Oy och Kreativa delaktiga Finland synliggör materialet på fyrk.fi i samarbete med Svenska kulturfonden. \n 1.  ÖVERGRIPANDE MÅL (långsiktiga mål) \n Högsta målnivån, ett eller flera övergripande mål som anger färdriktningen. Varför projektet är viktigt på sikt? Vilken förändring sker på lång sikt  I samhället och för individen till följd av projektet? Det är  ofta flera projekt, program och verksamheter som bidrar till uppfyllelse  av samma övergripande mål.  Politiska och ekonomiska beslut samt andra  förändringar i omvärlden kan också påverka måluppfyllelsen av  långsiktiga mål. Exempel på övergripande mål är ökad social  välfärd ellerförbättrad folkhälsa. Måluppfyllelse för dessa mål  är svår  för den enskilda projektägaren att mäta. Det är ofta på program- eller,  myndighetsnivå som  detta går att följa upp.2.  PROJEKTMÅL (medellångsiktiga mål) \n Projektmålet  är huvudinriktningen på projektet. Upp till denna nivå bär  projektägaren ett ansvar. Inom ramen för projekttiden och med tillsatta  resurser (personal, tid och budget) ska man uppnå detta mål genom att  först ha uppnått delmålen. Projektmålet kallas ofta för syfte  och projekt bör enbart ha ett huvudsyfte, ett projektmål. Projektmålet  beskriver den situation som förväntas råda efter projektslut  om projektet levererar förväntade resultat och förutsatt att de antaganden  om yttre faktorer som måste samverka med projektet har visat sig stämma. \n 3.  DELMÅL (mål som uppnås på kort sikt) \n Delmål ska uppnås på kort sikt och är resultat av de aktiviteter som genomförs inom ramen för projektet. Måluppfyllelsen  av delmålen är ett resultat av projektets aktiviteter.  En rad olika  aktiviteter krävs för att uppnå ett specifikt delmål. Det är därför  viktigt att en aktivitetsplan är kopplad till respektive delmål (se steg  5).Ett råd är att undvika för många delmål.  Om detvisar sig  att det  skulle bli fler delmål bör man överväga att dela in projektet i  flera projekt eller se om några delmål kan slås ihop. 4.  FÖRVÄNTADE PRESTATIONER \n Dessa är mycket påtagliga resultat på kort sikt, som en direkt följd av genomförda aktiviteter.Exempelvis:  ”100 personer utbildade inom  spelprogrammering genom  UKMs stöd till  ungdomar med särskilda behov” eller ”20 000 informationsbroschyrer upptryckta och distribuerade till arbetssökande ungdomar inom området  X”.Varje aktivitet i en plan leder därmed till en prestation, en  kortsiktig effekt, som ett direkt resultat av en aktivitet. Prestationer är viktiga för  att kunna beräkna till exempel en  detaljerad budget och upprätta en tidsplan.1.1 Välkommen \n 2.1 Vad är LFA-metoden? \n 3.1 Innan du börjar skriva på ansökan \n 4.1 Nationella bidrag, stiftelser och fonder \n 5.1 Mål- och resultatstyrning \n 6.1 Uppföljning och utvärdering \n 7 Materialbank \n 5.1 Mål- och resultatstyrning \n 5.2 Uppföljningsplan \n god planering \n väl genomförd uppföljning \n tillämpning av resultat genom en lärande utvärdering.

  "inline_text": "Frank Michaud, the former training officer for the Billings, MT Fire Department decided he needed a new tool for fighting fires safely and efficiently. After researching the piercing nozzles on the market he decided that the tool he needed had not yet been built. \n He turned to Wes Nelson, owner of ProFab Enterprises in Billings, MT. The result — one year and four prototypes later — is the Patented Fyrestick Piercing Nozzle, which quickly extinguishes fires in enclosed areas using a fraction of the water required by traditional methods. \n Frank Michaud, from the Billings Fire Department, gives examples of the uses of this firefighting tool that pierces virtually any surface to put out a fire. The unique design of the Fyrestick allows a firefighter to safely place it near the source of the flames with one or two individuals. Steam production comes through the piercing nozzle at 80-100 GPM, and this targeted spray can kill the fire in much less time than axing through to attack the flames. Thermal imaging technology can be used to locate the source of the blaze, and the Fyrestick is inserted through a roof, concrete or steel to extinguish it. This device uses a reduced amount of water, causes less damage and is a safer method of fighting fires. \n  We are proud to have our product carried by the following distributors. \n CONTACT US:\n            Home (current)\n         \n \n            Common Uses \n         \n \n            Maritime Fire Fighting \n         \n \n            Specs \n         \n \n            Order \n         \n \n            Testimonials \n         \n \n            Gallery \n         \n \n            Contact Us \n         \n \n            Home\n         \n \n            Common Uses\n         \n \n            Maritime Fire Fighting\n         \n \n            Specs\n         \n \n            Order\n         \n \n            Testimonials\n         \n \n            Gallery\n         \n \n            Contact Us\n         \n \n                © 2011 - 2021 Powered by WebitTM\n             \n \n                Sitemap\n             \n \n                    Terms \u0026 Conditions\n                 \n \n                Webit Login\n            ",

Damn Sun in Scorpio :) Anyhoo, here are a few photos of what I've been up to. \n  \n         More news from the witch's stead soon! \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 09:41 AM  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (2)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n This week has been completely nuts. I've spent more time in waiting rooms this week than I care to think about (don't worry, everything is fine), and my house looks as though someone has broken into it and turned it upside down. Today I need to do some serious cleaning, before I even think about picking up a hook or the needles. \n Speaking of which, all the knitting I've done in uncomfortable chairs has assisted me in doing my shoulder in, so I will have to hook probably for today at least. Tomorrow I'm hoping to spend some quality time with the stole I'm making for Gabby at American Yarns. \n The time I have been at home this week, I've set up my new astrology web blog. You can check it out here . \n Also, I've just joined Plurk. I'm sure I need another social web site the same as I need another hole in my head but hey, it looks like fun. \n  \n I promise I will be more loquacious over the next few days. Thanks for bearing with me folks. :) \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 06:10 AM  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (0)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n    \n  \n These are both the Pretty Thing cowl pattern from the Yarn Harlot.

I'm wondering if they would be better for the homeless than scarves. They are less chunky, but still very warm, and so small they would be easy to scrunch up and stash when not in use. Hmmm, will ponder that a bit more. \n  \n In other news, I'm going to be launching another blog soon, focusing on astrology.

We had our ups and downs initially resulting in two lots of frogging and starting over. I'm well into the pattern now, and enjoying it thoroughly. And it is certainly very, very pretty. It's not for me - no use for cowls in sub-tropical Queensland. I hope the recipient will be happy. I'm doing these on my new Addi circulars. They are great, but my one complaint would be that they aren't quite pointy enough. Unlike Knit Pros, which you could use as a weapon if you really wanted. \n Not quite casting on, as it's crochet, but I've started a blankie for my cousin's oldest son. I think I have the perfect teen boy colours, so I hope he likes it. His mother will love it because it won't show the dirt. \n I probably shouldn't mention the blanket I've started but not finished yet, or the two pairs of socks I still have on the needles. I probably should also not mention that I'm planning on casting on another pair of socks today - which will be a gift for the same lucky person who will be getting the cowl. \n  \n Have I mentioned that I would really love a clone? Or maybe the power of super speed. Hmm, the needles would probably catch on fire! \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 10:43 AM in crochet, knitting, Socks  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (0)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n I'm freshly home from the Brisbane Stitches and Craft show.  It was quite amusing as it was easy to spot the crafty people on the way there on the train. Mostly older women wearing eccentric handmade garb, or carrying handmade bags. I was astonished at the number of women trailing those bag-on-wheel things. I hope they managed to fill them up! \n  \n Funnier than that were the number of husbands sitting outside with a coffee and a newspaper, waiting for their wives to emerge. I do kinda feel sorry for crafting husbands, they seem to have limitless patience. \n  \n   \n The show itself was mainly geared towards quilters, scrapbookers and beaders. There were lots of very pretty sparkly things to look at. I ended up losing my mother and her friend (after they spent about half an hour in the first stall and I got tired of waiting for them) and wandered round by myself. It was a lovely morning. If you're a quilter, you'll need all day! \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 02:07 PM in Party!  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (3)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n Stephanie Pearl Macphee aka the Yarn Harlot, posed an interesting question in her blog the other day. How do non-knitters cope with stress? Or, is it that knitting attracts a certain type of person who needs maximum stress management? \n  \n As someone who suffers from an anxiety condition, knitting makes things tolerable for me. I can knit on public transport, which allows me to remove my focus from the crazies I'm on the train or bus with. It was particularly valuable on a day etched in my memory when an unwashed loonie got on the train, sat next to me and then said \"baaaa\" at regular intervals until we got to town (a good 20 minutes). My knitting helps me deal with being outside my comfort zone. Or, if I'm feeling particularly stressed out knitting helps bring me down so I can successfully interact with other people. It also helps me wind down at the end of the day. I can almost knit myself to sleep with that soothing repetitive motion. \n  \n  \n Would the world be a different place if kids were told to go do some knitting when they got cranky or stressed out?   \n  \n Knitters - how does the craft assist you in times of stress? \n  \n  \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 07:45 AM in Navel Gazing, Yarn Harlot  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (4)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n  \n    \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 02:45 PM in General Bitching, Navel Gazing  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (1)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n I'm not much of a sporting person, as I've mentioned in previous posts, but one of the sporting faces I've had respect for over the years is Frank Farina. Up until now. \n One of the things I've always found odd about Australians is the way we tend to treat our sporting heroes like rock stars. The various football leagues have had lots of trouble recently with their players misbehaving badly off field. These incidents are generally followed by the individual appearing dutifully remorseful for the cameras. For some reason, our sporting heroes are allowed to behave like unruly teenagers on their first night out on the town. Except teenagers have to stop drinking a lot earlier because they run out of money a lot more quickly than these men getting paid obscene amounts each year because they can kick a ball. \n  \n There is an anti drink driving campaign which runs on our television networks which states \"If you drink and drive, you're a bloody idiot.\" \n  \n Mr Farina is a bloody idiot. He was charged with drink driving for the second time in two years. This time, he was pulled over early in the morning (reports I've seen have reported times as being between 7 and 10 am) with a blood alcohol reading over twice the legal limit.There is no excuse for this behaviour for any member of the public, let alone a well renowned soccer coach.  Not only does Mr Farina deny that he has an alcohol issue, he is planning on suing the Brisbane Roar club due to their decision to terminate his contract because of his behaviour. Apparently, not driving while drunk was not a part of his contract. \n  \n Excuse me? \n  \n I am astonished at the suggestion that a sporting club should have to specify that a coach or player to not drink and drive. Should it also specify in a person's contract that they should not get drunk and beat up their partner? Surely if an action is considered an offence by the local laws, it should be taken as read that these behaviours won't be tolerated.  \n Sporting figures need to start taking responsibility for their actions and not expect that all will be forgiven because underneath, they are really top blokes. Grow up people, you are not that special. \n  \n I congradulate the Brisbane Roar club for taking such a stance and showing zero tolerance for such anti-social behaviour. \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 08:21 AM in Sports  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (1)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n I had such a full on day yesterday I completely forgot to blog! I hope the blogtober fairies won't smite me for this indiscretion! \n The reason I had such a huge day yesterday was that I had a job interview/try out kind of thing. Now it's a rare thing that you come away from an interview looking like this. \n  \n    \n The other night, I hit up the lovely Lesley from Chameleon Face Painting for a job. Yesterday I had a get together with her, and tried my hand at some face painting stuff, including completing someone's face (thanks again Lousie!) It was awesome fun, and Lesley has agreed to take me on and train me as a face painter.  \n I'm very excited. The idea of returning to a desk job was anathema to me. This is perfect. I'll be working with kids - and occasionally adults - and playing with pretty colours. Plus the witchlet is incredibly happy as I'll have to practice on her. She's been begging me for face paints for two years.  As soon as I'm a bit more skillful, I'll have a face painting party for her friends, so I will have a heap of little canvases to practice on.  \n On another note, it's one more sleep until Tina and Tim's wedding. Good luck kids! Hope you manage to get some sleep tonight!  \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 07:27 AM in face painting  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (1)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n  \n   \n  \n   \n I did finally finish Nellie's wavy blankie.

Just kidding Nell. \n  \n  \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  \n  \n I'm just over halfway with my mother's birthday socks. \n Working with these wonderful dark, rich colours has made me realise something ...

  "inline_text": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFirst Year Seminar (FYS) Course Offerings\n\n\t\t\t\t\t \n First-Year Seminars are a critical part of the Common Course of Study, a co-requisite for other courses taken by students in their first semester, and a prerequisite for subsequent courses. \n First Year Seminars are limited to around 16 students per section, the First-Year Seminar includes significant reading, writing, discussion, and presentation and is affiliated with the College Writing Program. Students in First-Year Seminars are introduced to the use of the library for research. \n Students should select their top 5 First-Year Seminar courses in order of preference. \n Students should understand that in case of a schedule conflict between a First-Year Seminar and a required major degree course, the major course will take precedence, and an alternate seminar option will be assigned. \n FYS 014 Individualism in American Culture, Character, and Society \n The term “individualism” has long been used to describe one of the distinctive qualities of Americans and of American culture. Using Alexis de Tocqueville’s Democracy in America (1840) as the starting point this colloquium systematically examines expressions of individualism in American life past and present. – Professor Schneiderman \n FYS 017 Making Change Democratically \n What does social change in a democracy look like? This course equips students with a framework for understanding how social change happens and allows them to identify issues in the local and regional communities surrounding the college that can be tackled through democratic action. Students will deepen their academic understanding while developing as informed, engaged, and effective civic agents. – Professor Rizvi \n FYS 20 Appalachia \n The region of the Eastern U.S. known as Appalachia is defined by the geological characteristics of the Appalachian Mountains, but also can be characterized and described on the basis of the distinctive natural, historical, cultural, and economic characteristics of the region. It will be the goal of this course to develop the skills to recognize, understand, and evaluate and communicate the complex interrelationships among those factors that define and describe this region of the U.S.  – Professor Husic \n FYS 25 Fútbol:  Inside the Beautiful Game \n In addition to offering mass entertainment, soccer has been used as a government propaganda machine, is the pillar of multi-billion-dollar enterprises, and has led to wars and questionable social behaviors. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we will explore how soccer is more than just a game. Drawing on readings from sociology, economics, and politics, we will look at soccer as a sport, a form of entertainment, a tool for oppressive regimes, a form of collective identity, and a major force for social change.”   – Professor Ospina-Giraldo \n FYS 27  Death on Screens \n This course examines the intersections of death and screen media while introducing ways to read and respond to complex visual texts. What is death, according to cinema? How has visual media depicted mortality and how do these representations determine our collective understanding of death and dying? How do film, television and evolving digital platforms prescribe and teach audiences what to think about death? Ultimately, what does it mean to encounter and consume death on screens?  – Professor A. Smith \n FYS 28 Money:  The Root of All Evil? \n While the most recent financial crisis has heightened awareness of what can happen when the financial systems runs amok, this crisis was just one of several that plagued the markets at various times within the last two centuries. This course focuses on the financial history of currency and the capital markets through a critical examination of their functioning and impact from their beginnings to the present day. – Professor Bukics \n FYS 35 Technology and Society:  Semiconductor Era \n This seminar explores sources and uses of energy in a technical society. Issues regarding fossil fuels, nuclear energy, solar energy, and alternative sources of energy are investigated. Conservation of energy and the storage of energy are discussed. Energy uses for plant and food production, transportation, industrial output, leisure activities, and the national defense are reviewed. Finally, the use of energy is examined in the context of atmospheric pollution, radiation, noise, and nuclear weapons. \n FYS 36 Trials of the Century \n This interdisciplinary seminar will examine the “Trials of the Century” that have captivated the general public’s attention because of the highly controversial issues they raised, the publicity they received, and the decisions that resulted. By examining these great trials, using political, historical and legal academic lenses, we will refine our critical analytical skills and better understand both our legal and political systems, and the resulting changes in law and society.  – Professor Murphy \n FYS 37 I Cannot Live Without Books (or Liberal Arts) \n Books have long been central to making and sharing knowledge, and colleges and universities have grown up around libraries and cultures of reading. How can a deeper understanding of the history of book production and use help us understand the idea of a liberal arts education? This course pursues these questions through research, creative projects, and especially hands-on work with Skillman Library’s rare books collection. \n FYS 43 Charisma \n Charisma, meaning “gift of grace,” denotes a deeply personal, yet anti-institutional type of authority, shared by certain cult leaders and revolutionaries, religious visionaries and political prophets, antinomians and avant garde artists. There is also the charisma of place and thing, from sacred shrines and objects, to famous art works and national monuments. The course will explore the meaning of charisma, with case studies in enthusiastic religion, political revolution, and antinomian avant garde art movements.  – Professor Schneiderman \n FYS 47 Life Sciences: A Human Endeavor in the Misinformation Age \n In the current age of rampant misinformation, how can we identify and understand legitimate research in the life sciences? How can we learn to distinguish among reliable information, propaganda, advertisements, and outright falsehoods?  We will explore various controversies and contemporary subjects in the life sciences, particularly those which involve the manipulation of scientific (or pseudoscientific) information as a means to deceive. The reading and writing assignments in this course explore how scientific knowledge is generated, tested, challenged, archived, reviewed, summarized, presented, discarded when necessary, and frequently abused along with the ethical issues associated with animal and human subjects research. Finally, we will also explore who scientists are in the 2020s with a goal of illuminating both the humanity and diversity of the people generating scientific knowledge and the limitations and challenges that they face.  – Professor Hines \n FYS 52 Weaponized Media: Living in a World of Bots, Trolls, and Disinformation (2 sections) \n Social media sites have become the most powerful distributors of information in human history. They’ve become not only sites of connection and friendship but also of power struggles and violence. This course will consider how malicious actors have weaponized media to change the outcomes of elections, facilitate genocide, and spread conspiracy theories. We will focus on the methods used to exploit social media and on the consequences such exploitation has for the nature of truth.  – Professor Laquintano \n FYS 59 Feed the World: Challenging Hunger \n This course offers an interdisciplinary look at our food from planting to harvest, distribution and packing, to our tables. Emphasis on combining a social sciences perspective with an engineering human-centered design process to define and address problems of world hunger. Focus on investigation, problem definition, and project-based learning of issues related to global hunger.  –Professor Stewart-Gambino \n FYS 58   Invention \n Youtubers. TikTokers. Podcasters. These are just a few of the names given to an emerging class of “celebrities” who make a living by sharing their creativity online. Much like famous inventors from history, contemporary content creators take advantage of new technologies to influence culture. But, are influencers inventors? Or, are they something different? This class considers what it means to be an inventor. By creating our own content, we will explore the nature of modern invention by attending to issues of creativity, authenticity, and work in digital environments.  – Professor Mitchell \n FYS 60 Jewish Writing \n Jewish writing has been a way to create group and individual identity. We will think about major themes and styles, and we will also talk about how Jewish writing is a good “case study” for understanding how writing helps us create a sense of self. This class analyzes primary texts from the Hebrew Bible to popular literature and memoirs. We will learn about the concepts of canon and genre to see how reading and interpretation have influenced the meaning of different types of Jewish writing. You will practice writing about Jewish texts as well as the types of reading and writing that appeal to you and why.  – Professor Carr \n FYS 68 Mobilizing Science \n Scientific research plays a critical role in the way societies overcome challenges and respond to crises. How do societies mobilize scientific activity in the face of such challenges? Who foots the bill? Who decides the priorities? The reading and writing assignments in this seminar will explore the complex interplay between different social forces that mobilize science toward specific ends and examine the moral and ethical quandaries scientists often face when deciding how and whether to participate in the resulting research effort.  – Professor. Thomas \n FYS 77 The Dog Course \n “Man’s best friend?” Nature’s most successful parasite? Employing a range of perspectives-literary, philosophical, archaeological, biological and technological-we will examine specific constructions of the dog at various moments in human history. We will consider issues of evolution, domestication, the morality and technology of breeding, and the psychological comforts of anthropomorphic representation. Because field trips and other required activities will involve contact with dogs, this course is not recommended for those who may be afraid of dogs or have health issues that could be made worse by interacting with dogs.  – Professor. Falbo \n FYS 81 On Punk \n Music. Anger. Yelling. Lifestyle. Anarchism. Sex. Community. The punk ethos takes on and goes beyond these concepts. Its multiple afterlives engage in critiques of past and current political-economic systems and formations: colonialism, capitalism, imperialism, and patriarchy. Approaching punk from different media (music, sound, visuals, fiction and non-fiction literatures, documentaries), students will navigate through past/current subcultures based in Mexico City, Los Angeles, Medellin, Lima, New York, and San Juan. Assignments will replicate punk’s DIY spirit.  – Professor Rodriguez-Ulloa \n FYS 83 Surviving the Zombie Apocalypse \n A full-scale, devastating global pandemic of the kind depicted in many contemporary zombie movies would challenge all of humanity to marshal its resources and solve problems both new and age old. In order for human beings to survive such an apocalyptic scenario, we would need to put every bit of learning and human endeavor (intellectual and other) to work. This course will use the pop culture trope of a zombie apocalypse to introduce students to various kinds of academic inquiry.  – Professor. Tatu \n FYS 86 Propaganda \n What is propaganda? What are some of the most common propaganda techniques? How, if at all, does propaganda differ from other forms of persuasion? Is the use of propaganda to influence opinion always ethically suspect? How is it suspect? Is it possible that propaganda could be used to communicate accurate information, or must propaganda always be misleading? This First Year Seminar examines these and related questions from an historical, sociological, psychological and philosophical perspective.  – Professor Shieber \n FYS 109 Understanding Design \n In this seminar course, students use observational drawing, structured observation, journaling, readings, discussion, and writing to develop their ability to observe, discuss, and evaluate the use of common design elements in the spaces and objects that surround us and that comprise the built environment – the human-made environment where we spend most of our lives.  -Professor Roth \n FYS 114 The Values of Cinema \n Learn how to look at works of cinematic art in an informed and reflective way. We will emphasize the importance, to properly understanding and evaluating a movie, of considering all of its cinematic features, including genre, relationship to other works, screenplay, camera work, music, etc., and of becoming informed on whatever is relevant to the content conveyed-all features that a casual viewer might miss. The seminar includes film screenings outside of regular class time.  – Professor Giovannelli \n FYS 117 Demonstrating Science \n Scientific demonstrations are used in lectures, science museums, and television shows to explain scientific principles and inspire wonder about science. How important are such demonstrations to a true understanding of science? Is seeing believing? Is seeing understanding? In this course we will explore the science behind some popular demonstrations and consider the ways in which such demonstrations have educated, obfuscated, or inspired their audiences.  – Professor Boekelheide \n FYS 120 Theater and Visual Culture \n Our first books are picture books, but as we learn to read, the images disappear and our education focuses on reading and writing WORDS. Yet thousands of images surround us each day-in advertising, media, and theater-yet we are rarely taught how to read, analyze, or acknowledge as intellectual property the non-verbal modes of communication. This course will introduce students to techniques for analyzing visual images, focusing on: static images (such as print advertising), “sequential art” (such as graphic novels) and the “languages” of the stage (such as collaborative performance). We will discuss how we receive and respond to images, and how those images function artistically, ethically, and culturally.  – Professor Westfall \n FYS 127   I Know You Are, But What Am I? \n This course follows the path of ideas about the self and society outside Western textual traditions. Focusing on exchanges of ideas in selected Asian traditions, we will consider diverse ways of thinking about our own identities and how they relate to our social lives. Along the way, we will hopefully also come to question some of the assumptions we have about who we are and how social life works.   – Professor Gallemore \n FYS 130 Being Non-Human (2 sections) \n What does it mean to be human in the contemporary world? Is there a common humanity? If so, what do humans share with each other that other living beings do not have? In this course we will explore how the definition of humanity has historically rested on assumptions about nonhuman life, and we will consider how various scholars and artists have approached the nonhuman—from bacteria to animals to cyborgs—in their work.  – Professor Vora \n FYS 138 Theater and Social Justice \n For thousands of years, the theater has both entertained and provided a forum in which social issues can be explored. This seminar will investigate, through readings and performances, how theater provides an immediate and strong voice to debate social and political problems. Students will have opportunities, through writing, discussion, and theatrical performance, to explore social and political issues and the ways in which dramatic works can inspire social change.  – Professor Lodge \n FYS 141 Mathematics of Social Justice (2 sections) \n Alexander Hamilton said, “The first duty of society is justice.” Today there is vociferous argument about the prevalence of justice. To what degree is society just? Are there practical ways to make it more just? This course considers the importance of understanding data and applying mathematics to ask these questions and to explore meaningful answers. Using mathematics that everybody is taught, we’ll try to make sense out of conflicting opinions, so as to discover the importance of quantitative literacy for all citizens in a democracy. \n FYS 143 Coffee (2 sections) \n Coffee has a ubiquitous and somewhat unique role in our society. While some tend to think of it merely as a vehicle for caffeine, it is also the basis on which cafe culture originated and exists, a highly-traded commodity crop with huge economic impacts and worldwide sourcing, and a finely-calibrated culinary subfield that draws on myriad engineering and chemical approaches to generate wildly different sensory experiences. The sheer level of integration of coffee into every aspect of our lives makes it a highly suitable interdisciplinary topic to consider and explore. This course aims to train students in information literacy via the investigation of coffee from several scholarly angles: a social approach, where students ask themselves (and others) the values and importance of the ritualistic nature of coffee and how it fits into their everyday lives; a scientific approach, where different flavor and texture experiences are explored; an engineering approach, where aspects of a coffee extraction are modulated to yield vastly different results; and finally, a humanist approach, which ties together what they have observed over the semester, and asks them to express their ideas of what defines a positive coffee experience.  – Professor Woo \n FYS 151 In the Media \n This course provides the opportunity to engage in public scholarship related to the major issues, institutions, and individuals shaping the 2020 US national elections and its consequences. Students will produce visual essays designed to communicate knowledge through the visual broadcast media. Video essays that meet the quality standards and guidelines for editorial integrity may be aired on PBS39 as part of its 2020 election coverage.  -Professor Crain \n FYS 156 Narratives of Mental Illness \n Obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourettes syndrome, depression, eating disorders-this seminar introduces students to a wide range of texts (memoirs and first-person narratives, films, painting, and medical and philosophical treatises) that focus on the experience of living with mental illness. Particular attention is paid to the style and form of textual representations of psychological disorders, as well as to the cultural and philosophical questions such texts raise about the very category of “mental illness.” – Professor Cefalu \n FYS 158 Nonviolence: Theory and Practice (2 sections) \n This course explores both the theoretical development of nonviolence and the practice of nonviolence as a means for waging and resolving conflict. Using the examples of Mohandas Gandhi and India’s independence movement, the 1989 revolutions in Eastern Europe, the power of music in the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, as well as the personal testimonies of individuals and various groups pursuing nonviolent change in the Lehigh Valley, this course explores the principles of nonviolence in action. – Professor Fabian \n FYS 166 Atheism and Skepticism \n Why have people chosen to be atheists or skeptics? What arguments have they used to support their positions? Several recent bestselling books have criticized organized religion as a dangerous delusion, and scientists are currently searching for a possible biological (rather than supernatural) basis for religious faith. Criticism of religion, however, has a long and colorful history. In this course, we will study examples of atheism and skepticism in different cultural contexts from Asia and the West.  –Professor Rinehart \n FYS 167 Animals in History \n How have “animals” and “humans” made history together? How can we think and write about history beyond the human? Through the reading and writing assignments in this course, students will reflect on their own understandings of human-animal relationships over the last several centuries in cities, entertainment, food, empire, and the “wild.” We will approach these questions through various lenses: environmental history, cultural history, disability studies, political anthropology, and the history of capitalism.  – Professor Zallen \n FYS 169 The 1960s:  The Causes and Effects of Social Change \n The Civil Rights Movement, the Antiwar Movement, the Space Race, and, of course, Sex, Drugs and Rock ‘n Roll…Through an examination of written and oral histories, documentary film, the poetry, music and visual arts of the Sixties, students will explore the underlying causes for change during the nation’s most tumultuous decades. In addition to the causes, students will determine for themselves the influences that the 1960s have had on the present day. – Professor Newman \n FYS 173 Latinx \n Popular media from the news to film is filled with references to Latinos and Latinas, but what do we really know about them? This course explores the Latinization of the United States, highlighting the social, demographic and cultural forces that have shaped Latino/a experiences in recent decades. Specific course content includes social scientific studies of Latino/a immigration and community formation, and representations of and by Latinos/as in novels, essays, TV and movies.  – Professor Donnell \n FYS 179 Leveraging Social Entrepreneurship (2 sections) \n Market-based social entrepreneurship as an approach to addressing poverty, unfreedoms and the lack of localized agency among the poor in economic development has seen a rise in prominence. This is often attributed to the failures of national governments, multi-lateral agencies, and conventional philanthropy to respond dynamically to the challenges posed by changing global and technology landscapes. These failures also reflect a reliance on an outmoded development paradigm that is both inattentive and unresponsive to the modern needs of income poor people to be primary owners of their development experiences, a possibility made more realistic because of globalization and technological change. In essence, as first noted by Adam Smith and reported in Amarta Sen, freedom of exchange and transaction is in itself part and parcel of the basic liberties that people have to celebrate, and as Sen himself points out, “the freedom to participate in economic interchange has a basic role in social living.”  – Professor Hutchinson \n FYS 189 Silk Roads and Sea Routes:  East-West Trade and Intercultural Exchange in Pre-Modern Times \n From the 2nd c. BCE to the 15th c. CE, the Eurasian continent was profoundly transformed by the “Silk Roads,” a series of overland and maritime trade routes stretching between China and Rome. This course will explore not only the exotic goods that were traded, including silk, porcelain, gold, and even horses, but also the transmission of religious beliefs (Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity), artistic and musical practices, and technologies between peoples of vastly different cultures.  – Professor Furniss \n FYS 195 Russia Today \n “A riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma,” is how Winston Churchill famously described Russia. Decades later, after the Cold War and amidst the resurgence of Russia’s influence on the world stage, this FYS asks the question: what is Russia today? Taking into account conservative and liberal currents, we will study mass media, contemporary literature and cinema, and activism under Putin with an eye to challenging our assumptions about Russian culture, identity, and history. \n FYS 197 Deconstructing “Africa” \n This first year seminar addresses popular images of the African continent with the intention of getting beyond media stereotypes of poverty, hunger, and ethnic conflict. It tackles these problematic ideas by reading African novels and watching African films in order to better grasp how writers and artists from across the continent have imagined “Africa.” Classic works by Chinua Achebe, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o, Bessie Head, J. M. Coetzee, and Chimamanda Adichie will be assigned, as well as films by Ousmane Sembène, Djibril Diop Mambéty, and Mati Diop. Students will have weekly writing assignments as well as a research paper to gather their reflections and develop critical analytic skills which they can apply to future coursework.  – Professor Lee\n\t\t\t\n\t\tAbout Us\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tLafayette at a Glance\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tMission \u0026 History\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOur Values\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInspired Leadership\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWhy Not?\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tLafayette at a Glance\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tMission \u0026 History\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tOur Values\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tInspired Leadership\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tWhy Not?\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\tAcademics\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDepartments \u0026 Programs\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOur Faculty\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCurriculum Offerings\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCollege Catalog\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tLibrary\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAcademic Support\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAcademic Calendar\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tDepartments \u0026 Programs\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tOur Faculty\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tCurriculum Offerings\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tCollege Catalog\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tLibrary\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tAcademic Support\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tAcademic Calendar\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\tCampus Life\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tLiving on Campus\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tClubs \u0026 Organizations\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe Arts\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAthletics\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDiversity \u0026 Inclusion\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSustainability\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTraditions\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAbout Easton\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tLiving on Campus\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tClubs \u0026 Organizations\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tThe Arts\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tAthletics\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tDiversity \u0026 Inclusion\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tSustainability\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tTraditions\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tAbout Easton\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\tAdmissions \u0026 Aid\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWhat We Look For\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAdmissions Visits\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHow to Apply\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCollege Costs\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFinancial Aid\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDeadlines and Forms\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tMeet Our Team\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPolicies\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tWhat We Look For\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tAdmissions Visits\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tHow to Apply\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tCollege Costs\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tFinancial Aid\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tDeadlines and Forms\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tMeet Our Team\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tPolicies\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\tAthletics\n\n\t\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\tThe Arts\n\n\t\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\tNews\n\n\t\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\tEvents\n\n\t\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\tGiving\n\n\t\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\tStudents\n\n\t\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\tFaculty \u0026 Staff\n\n\t\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\tFamilies\n\n\t\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\tAlumni\n\n\t\t\t\t \n First Semester Course Selectio…\t \n Explore the First Year Seminar \n First Semester Course Selection Preferences\n\n\tMessage from Class Dean\n\tPlacement Exams\n\tExplore Majors \u0026 Programs\n\tExplore the First Year Seminar\n\tExplore Fall Course Offerings\n\tCourse Selection Resources\n\tSubmit Your Course Selections\n\tResources for International Students\n\tFAQ\n\n \n Message from Class Dean \n Placement Exams \n Explore Majors \u0026 Programs \n Explore the First Year Seminar \n Explore Fall Course Offerings \n Course Selection Resources \n Submit Your Course Selections \n Resources for International Students \n FAQ \n The program gives new college students the opportunity to think critically, write clearly, and contribute to thoughtful discussions.  Learn more.\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\tInside look at the First-Year Seminars\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe program gives new college students the opportunity to think critically, write clearly, and contribute to thoughtful discussions.  Learn more.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n",

  "inline_text": "Fyrecurl \n \n\t\t\t\tThe feminine perspective\t\t\t \n I’ve come to hate my body and all that it requires of me in this world …  \n                   Cindy was the speaker that first day I walked into the basement of Christ’s church. She sat cross-legged in the overstuffed chair at the corner of our circle looking like she got into a bout with a pit bull. Her lip was split, and her eyes blackened and purple, separated by a narrow white bandage across the bridge of her nose. Everyone was listening intently to what appeared to be a young woman in the “hot seat”, a box of tissue in her lap, sputtering in a little-girl voice about her boyfriend. \n  “After\nI informed him about my upcoming operation in Montreal, he made it abundantly\nclear he did not want to ever see me again. He broke my nose. It wasn’t\npretty,” she said and dabbed a dry eye with a tissue.  \n “He knocked out two of my front teeth. I had\nto scramble around on the floor after he had gone, looking for them so the\ndentist could put them back in.”  \n I had pictured a\nbunch of middle-aged men trying to dress like the woman of their dreams. Lost\nsouls trying to reinvent themselves into some idyllic embodiment of femininity\nthat they imagined when they were teenagers, before puberty rubbed them the\nwrong way. Instead, there was Cindy with her long brown hair tucked behind each\near, in her too-long sweater and a pair of thread-bare stirrups looking like a\nrebellious adolescent. When I found out she was a mechanic for a Sears Auto\nCenter, there was a connection. I was not just surprised but ecstatic. I felt\nthere may be hope for me yet.  \n Caught up in the\neuphoria, I asked her to lunch. I wanted to know more. We went to a small deli\non the outskirts of town. No one gave us a second look. Two girlfriends out to\nlunch.  \n Afterward, I let\nher drive my sporty 5-speed Honda Civic at top speed through the rolling hills\nof West Hartford to an apartment she shared with Laura. The two of them plied\nme with whiskey and wine, dressed me up like a prostitute and took me out to a\ngay bar near Amherst.  \n I woke up naked\nbetween them in an unfamiliar bed that smelled like sweat and vomit. I dressed\nquickly and drove back to Vermont. I barely glanced in her direction since that\nfirst meeting. It wasn’t long into my transition that I realized not every\nmember of my support group was the same kind of crazy as me.  \n  Traci was one of the first like me that I had met. At five feet four inches tall with diminutive features and a lovely face, she was that hot new model everyone at the XX Club aspired to be—no matter what variety of fruit they were. Traci  almost a half-million before coming into the XX Club. She and I were more financially stable than most of the others. It gave us some perks. Joe, the person I would eventually move in with, was more scrutinized by the gatekeepers. The clinic made him get his wife to sign off on his hormone shots, but he was undaunted.  \n “They pay more attention to me than you guys,”\nhe laughed. \n Canon Clinton\nJones, the club’s co-founder and social worker, usually sat in\none of the chairs facing the door and smiled at me and the others as we came\nin. Traci compared him to Saint Peter thinning out the flock of lost souls as\nthey came up to the pearly gates. He seldom spoke unless someone had a question\nfor him. He sat quietly, small white hands folded neatly on his lap, legs\ncrossed at the knee and observed while Jennifer, our club president, ran the\nmeeting. Canon Jones was there, he reminded us, to help us help ourselves. Our\njob was not so much to learn how to become women, but to unlearn all the years\nof living behind a mask of masculinity.  \n Jennifer\ndescribed it as peeling an onion, one layer at a time. It\nwould bring tears, but it was necessary before you could find that tender\nheart. Jennifer loved metaphors. She usually misquoted or mixed them up in an\nendearing sort of way. She was soft-spoken and plain and didn’t wear much\nmakeup. Her graying blond hair was tied up in a bun or stuck under some frumpy\nhat, and she always showed up in a long skirt and loose knit sweater like some\nold hippie chick. She looked like the grown-up version of Annie Hall.  \n Jennifer was one\nof the oldest members of the club and the main topic of conversation during our\nbreaks. No one was certain whether she had had SRS or not, but everyone held\nher in high esteem. We all knew her intentions were good. Besides, Canon Jones,\nand one of the former members who presided over my first meeting before leaving\nto parts unknown, she was one of the few people that appeared to care about our\nprogress and tried to be comforting.  \n She used to be an\nengineer at a big firm in Manhattan until she walked into the office one day\nwith her thinning blond hair tied back in a bun behind her head and in a long,\nknit skirt and cowl-neck sweater. Her partners called her into the boardroom\nand offered her an early retirement package she could not refuse.  \n When she was not\nrunning our meetings or arguing with her live-in girlfriend Julie, she stayed\nhome by a phone in her anteroom waiting for a call from her son. Gossip had it,\nwhen Jennifer’s ex-wife informed the boy what was going on with his father, he\nnever returned home from Penn State.  \n The greatest part\nof the gossip however was Julie, an ex-priest. She was a bit disconcerting to\nbe around. It was bad enough for most to descend into the bowels of a church\ndressed in ways that could get you arrested in the 1990’s and share intimate\nsecrets with complete strangers but she made it even more uncomfortable.  \n Julie was that\nnun from Hell, the one who dragged you out of your seat by the ear and stood\nyou in front of the entire class telling you that your zipper was open and\nforbade you to look down to see if it really was. Not only did her outfit\nresemble the Carmelite nuns that taught me for the first eight years of my\nacademic life, her mannerisms reminded me of my Seventh-grade teacher, Sister\nAloysius, right down to the nervous tic of her mouth whenever she scolded you\nfor slouching in your chair.  \n With the\nexception of Julie’s starched blouse that was usually\npetrified-white, she wore black like a second skin. Black dress, black sweater,\nblack-framed glasses, and her black hair tied back with a black ribbon. She\nwore black nun-shoes—the kind with a thick heel and blunt toe. Julie and\nJennifer lived together in Jennifer’s large stately home off King’s Highway in\nan old established neighborhood in Bridgeport.  \n Julie was still on the books as the club vice\npresident but seldom showed for meetings. When someone inquired, Jennifer would\nsay, “Busy bees must make honey while they can,” or “busy is, busy does.” It\ndidn’t really answer the question but stifled any further inquiry.  \n Most were thankful she didn’t come. No one\nwanted to be reminded to keep their legs closed or crossed at the knee if you\nwere wearing a dress or skirt or stopped at some penultimate moment at the\nclimax of a personal story shared with the group for the first time. She would\ntell someone if she thought the subject matter was inappropriate even on breaks\nand no one wanted to be reminded again and again that this was not a place to\nmake “new best friends” simply when you stopped to talk to someone after a meeting.     \n Traci’s boots\nwere on the floor under her chair. Her feet securely tucked up under her while\nshe huddled under her parka with the collar pulled up to her chin. Her breath\nfloated aimlessly up through the loose fabric. She caught me staring and gave\nme the thumbs up. She approved of my casual look—a pair of my daughter Jackie’s\nold jeans hugged my thighs and a long red sweater clung to my budding round\nbosom. If you could pass in androgynous clothing, you had made it.  \n Traci said no matter how good we look someone\nalways sees who we once were. Our past creeps through. My eyes narrowed on her\npretty face when she said it. I found it hard to tell the difference between\nher and any of my sisters. She was, without question, as cute as any teenage prom\nqueen.  \n “Don’t worry, you’ll get there. Give them\nmoaning whores time to do their magic.”  \n That’s what she called hormones. I was never\nquite sure whether she laughed at my insecurity or her little pundit. \n It was Traci who convinced me to move in with\nJoe for my year of living in my chosen gender, as required by the program.  \n “You can cart each other around from place to\nplace until all your surgeries are complete. No one can go through this alone.”\n \n When I asked who assisted her, she just\nsmiled. \n Traci planned on\ngoing deep stealth. She stayed to herself at meetings and avoided interaction\nwith anyone who might give her away. She barely talked to the others except\ncordially. Although not formally appointed, she was my mentor. By the time I\nmoved from Vermont to Hartford, she was halfway through with her ‘year\nof living dangerously’ as she called that time when we strapped our sex up\nbetween our legs and put on a dress, usually for the first time.  \n I was fortunate\nshe took me under her wing. I came dressed that first day in blue jeans and\nwork boots looking more like gay Bruce Springsteen than a Lola. I had no\nexperience dressing up as a girl except a few times on Halloween but that ended\nin the sixth grade, after my father told my mother I looked like a squirrel.\nAll I dared wear was a dab of mascara for fear of getting seen by someone I\nknew.  \n I had a key to my\nfriend, Frank’s, dental office in Brattleboro. He was never\nthere on weekends and I would stop by to use the bathroom and lightly line my\neyes with a black pencil and fluff out my curly hair with a pick, making my\nandrogynous appearance a little more feminine. But it wasn’t long after the\nhormones kicked in that my friends and people that I have known for years began\ntalking about me in those hushed whispers reserved for folks who claimed to be\nabducted by aliens. \n “Look at those two idiots.”  \n Traci jerked her head in the direction of two\nnewbies sitting across from us. She kept her voice low. \n “The tall blonde calls herself Proud Mary. She\nshowed up at the last meeting in a long red dress and a white sweater. A bloody\nmess.”  \n Traci had a euphemism for every regular in the\nclub and labeled the newbies if they came back a second time. Whenever she\ncalled me Saint Evelyn my stomach knotted but when she used the epithets that\nshe gave the regulars, I got more nervous.  \n Besides Joe, Jennifer and Scary Julie, the ex-priest, there was Sarah the eunuch and Laura the admirer. Cindy was the whiner of the group and Hawk-nose Kaitlyn was the youngest member to regularly attend our meetings. Both she and Cindy were in their late twenties and were rail thin. Traci called them Zeros. I didn’t know it referenced a dress size. I thought she was being derogatory, like all her other labels.  \n “Joe calls her Big Kathy,” I said referring to\nthe tall blonde. Traci was unconcerned with what other people thought. I never\nrealized how prejudiced she was towards our own kind.   \n “Like most of these freaks she works in IT and\nis married. Isn’t that Barbie?”  \n Traci nodded in the direction of a newbie in a\nwhite dress. \n “No, I don’t think so. She’s Hispanic. Her\neyes are slanted. Barbie had big eyes like the doll, remember. That’s why we\ncalled her that.” \n “Cripes! That’s right. It’s hard to keep track\nof all the freaks. Where do they all come from?”  \n Jennifer brought\nher finger up to her thin colorless lips. Petite Cindy was in the ‘hot\nseat’ blubbering something about stenosis and an opening the size of a pencil\nnub. She was always crying or feigning emotional trauma to draw sympathy. Her\nlarge dark eyes looked down into her empty lap. Cindy spoke in a\nmonotone-droll-little-girl voice. Her eyes were wide-open and dry. There were\nno tears, but people around her, especially the newbies, feigned empathy as\nthough it was expected of them.  \n People didn’t\nnormally cry at meetings. Most of our tears were used up long ago as children.\nSelf-pity is unusual for a tranny who survived past puberty. It succumbed to an\nemotional cancer that spread quietly into the trauma of our teen years when we\nnoticed the developing bodies of the girls born in the right body. Pity was\nreplaced by an emptiness and self-loathing before we became adults.  \n Some had a chip on their shoulder, but when\nmost first came to the club and realized they were not alone they were elated\nor relieved. No one cried in a meeting unless it was a story about them. How\nshe was molested by a family member or sitting in a warm bath at the age of six\ncontemplating how to cut off the male genitals that did not belong on her body\nwithout bleeding to death.   \n Jennifer liked\nCindy for some reason. She often sat in the hot seat. Cindy retold her story\nabout her botched operation by an incompetent Montreal surgeon at almost every\nmeeting. We were the experimental people. Dr. Menard had tried a new spiral\ngrafting procedure to improve on the healing process of the neo-vagina.\nHowever, something went horribly wrong, if you believed Cindy.  \n “Cindy is a drama queen,” Traci said. She\nthought Cindy failed to follow directions and insert the prosthetic device into\nthe raw wound twice a day to keep it open until it healed. I pictured the\nlittle girl in The Exorcist stabbing\nher crotch when she said it and winced. Physical pain to pacify our emotional\ntrauma. \n  Sarah’s\nhair was cut short like a boy’s but he looked and sounded like a woman because\nhe never went through puberty. He contracted syphilis when he was 9. That’s\nwhen his mother’s boyfriend moved into their trailer. Sarah told me he used to\nsneak into her room at night when her mother passed out from the drugs that he\ngave her.  \n “He was a sick man.”  \n She almost\nsounded sorry for him.  \n I felt sorry for\nSarah. She didn’t talk much. When she did, it was usually to\ncertain people like me or Laura, who she moved in with when she came up from\nthe New York City. Laura and Sarah were not real members of the XX Club.\nNeither were candidates for sexual reassignment, but Canon Jones let them join\nthe support group whenever they felt like killing themselves.   \n Sarah didn’t\nmake eye contact. She usually looked down at her feet when she spoke or at her\nlap if she was sitting. Her voice was low, and you’d have to strain to hear it.\nShe didn’t talk much to the others, but for some reason, she did talk to me.  \n Everyone seemed to confide in me and tell me\nthings I did not want to hear, especially Joe. Sometimes people told me too\nmuch—those dirty little secrets that should be locked in a box in the back of a\ncloset or swept under a bed. I kept a smile pressed to my lips and listened and\ntried not to think about how it would affect me.  \n From meeting to\nmeeting, I barely remembered the ones I saw from the previous month. A handful\nof newbies came and went from time to time, but no one noticed when they didn’t\nshow up again. We were keenly aware that only a handful would make it out alive\nand were relieved when we were still sitting in that imperfect circle of\nchairs.  \n One week several\nnewbies appeared at once. A Konstanz with a “Z” she said,\nthen a Bronwyn, and our hawk-nosed Katlyn paraded in wearing heels and heavy\nmakeup probably for the first time. The more flamboyant monikers revealed a\nchange in attitude among the community as if they were no longer ashamed of\nbeing born odd. They reinvented themselves like children playing in a\nmake-believe world pretending to be something different than they were born—not\nquite a white knight, a soldier, or cowboy but almost always a damsel in\ndistress.  \n I didn’t\nknow why anyone would want to be a victim but some of the newbies tended to\nrevel in it like it was their destiny. They came in to challenge the\ngatekeepers, who tried without success to screen them out. The clinic staff\nfound the majority of the support group were these new gender-warriors, many\nalso in need of services. They did not want to change their sex. They\ndisappeared at an alarming rate when they or Canon Jones realized the program\nwas not designed to accommodate them. \n We turned off\nreality. When someone was missing at the next meeting, we did not ask\nquestions. They could be dead or just decided to revert back to the real world\nand hang up their heels for a while. We never knew. We’d see a newbie sitting\nin a chair where the recently deceased should be and we’d go on acting as\nthough they showed up again—transformed. \n I attended\nseveral meetings, twice a month, while still living at home in Vermont. But as\nthe hormonal therapy progressed, and I began to look and feel differently, I\nknew I had to leave the safety of my home and family if I was to ever become\nthe person, I knew I was meant to be.   \n\n#\n\n\n\n \n \n\t\tSingle, White, Female, Over 50 years of age, Juris Doctor, Masters in non-fiction writing, perpetual student of life;\t\t\n\t\t\tView more posts\t\t\n\t \n Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in: \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t( Log Out / \n\t\t\t\tChange )\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your Google account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t( Log Out / \n\t\t\t\tChange )\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your Twitter account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t( Log Out / \n\t\t\t\tChange )\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your Facebook account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t( Log Out / \n\t\t\t\tChange )\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n Connecting to %s \n  Notify me of new comments via email. \n  Notify me of new posts via email. \n  \n\n \n  \n This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

It\nwould bring tears, but it was necessary before you could find that tender\nheart. Jennifer loved metaphors. She usually misquoted or mixed them up in an\nendearing sort of way. She was soft-spoken and plain and didn’t wear much\nmakeup. Her graying blond hair was tied up in a bun or stuck under some frumpy\nhat, and she always showed up in a long skirt and loose knit sweater like some\nold hippie chick. She looked like the grown-up version of Annie Hall. \n\n\n\nJennifer was one\nof the oldest members of the club and the main topic of conversation during our\nbreaks. No one was certain whether she had had SRS or not, but everyone held\nher in high esteem. We all knew her intentions were good. Besides, Canon Jones,\nand one of the former members who presided over my first meeting before leaving\nto parts unknown, she was one of the few people that appeared to care about our\nprogress and tried to be comforting. \n\n\n\nShe used to be an\nengineer at a big firm in Manhattan until she walked into the office one day\nwith her thinning blond hair tied back in a bun behind her head and in a long,\nknit skirt and cowl-neck sweater. Her partners called her into the boardroom\nand offered her an early retirement package she could not refuse. \n\n\n\nWhen she was not\nrunning our meetings or arguing with her live-in girlfriend Julie, she stayed\nhome by a phone in her anteroom waiting for a call from her son. Gossip had it,\nwhen Jennifer’s ex-wife informed the boy what was going on with his father, he\nnever returned home from Penn State. \n\n\n\nThe greatest part\nof the gossip however was Julie, an ex-priest. She was a bit disconcerting to\nbe around. It was bad enough for most to descend into the bowels of a church\ndressed in ways that could get you arrested in the 1990’s and share intimate\nsecrets with complete strangers but she made it even more uncomfortable. \n\n\n\nJulie was that\nnun from Hell, the one who dragged you out of your seat by the ear and stood\nyou in front of the entire class telling you that your zipper was open and\nforbade you to look down to see if it really was. Not only did her outfit\nresemble the Carmelite nuns that taught me for the first eight years of my\nacademic life, her mannerisms reminded me of my Seventh-grade teacher, Sister\nAloysius, right down to the nervous tic of her mouth whenever she scolded you\nfor slouching in your chair. \n\n\n\nWith the\nexception of Julie’s starched blouse that was usually\npetrified-white, she wore black like a second skin. Black dress, black sweater,\nblack-framed glasses, and her black hair tied back with a black ribbon. She\nwore black nun-shoes—the kind with a thick heel and blunt toe. Julie and\nJennifer lived together in Jennifer’s large stately home off King’s Highway in\nan old established neighborhood in Bridgeport. \n\n\n\nJulie was still on the books as the club vice\npresident but seldom showed for meetings. When someone inquired, Jennifer would\nsay, “Busy bees must make honey while they can,” or “busy is, busy does.” It\ndidn’t really answer the question but stifled any further inquiry. \n\n\n\nMost were thankful she didn’t come. No one\nwanted to be reminded to keep their legs closed or crossed at the knee if you\nwere wearing a dress or skirt or stopped at some penultimate moment at the\nclimax of a personal story shared with the group for the first time. She would\ntell someone if she thought the subject matter was inappropriate even on breaks\nand no one wanted to be reminded again and again that this was not a place to\nmake “new best friends” simply when you stopped to talk to someone after a meeting.    \n\n\n\nTraci’s boots\nwere on the floor under her chair. Her feet securely tucked up under her while\nshe huddled under her parka with the collar pulled up to her chin. Her breath\nfloated aimlessly up through the loose fabric. She caught me staring and gave\nme the thumbs up. She approved of my casual look—a pair of my daughter Jackie’s\nold jeans hugged my thighs and a long red sweater clung to my budding round\nbosom. If you could pass in androgynous clothing, you had made it. \n\n\n\nTraci said no matter how good we look someone\nalways sees who we once were. Our past creeps through. My eyes narrowed on her\npretty face when she said it. I found it hard to tell the difference between\nher and any of my sisters. She was, without question, as cute as any teenage prom\nqueen. \n\n\n\n“Don’t worry, you’ll get there. Give them\nmoaning whores time to do their magic.” \n\n\n\nThat’s what she called hormones. I was never\nquite sure whether she laughed at my insecurity or her little pundit.\n\n\n\nIt was Traci who convinced me to move in with\nJoe for my year of living in my chosen gender, as required by the program. \n\n\n\n“You can cart each other around from place to\nplace until all your surgeries are complete. No one can go through this alone.”\n\n\n\n\nWhen I asked who assisted her, she just\nsmiled.\n\n\n\nTraci planned on\ngoing deep stealth. She stayed to herself at meetings and avoided interaction\nwith anyone who might give her away. She barely talked to the others except\ncordially. Although not formally appointed, she was my mentor. By the time I\nmoved from Vermont to Hartford, she was halfway through with her ‘year\nof living dangerously’ as she called that time when we strapped our sex up\nbetween our legs and put on a dress, usually for the first time. \n\n\n\nI was fortunate\nshe took me under her wing. I came dressed that first day in blue jeans and\nwork boots looking more like gay Bruce Springsteen than a Lola. I had no\nexperience dressing up as a girl except a few times on Halloween but that ended\nin the sixth grade, after my father told my mother I looked like a squirrel.\nAll I dared wear was a dab of mascara for fear of getting seen by someone I\nknew. \n\n\n\nI had a key to my\nfriend, Frank’s, dental office in Brattleboro. He was never\nthere on weekends and I would stop by to use the bathroom and lightly line my\neyes with a black pencil and fluff out my curly hair with a pick, making my\nandrogynous appearance a little more feminine. But it wasn’t long after the\nhormones kicked in that my friends and people that I have known for years began\ntalking about me in those hushed whispers reserved for folks who claimed to be\nabducted by aliens.\n\n\n\n“Look at those two idiots.” \n\n\n\nTraci jerked her head in the direction of two\nnewbies sitting across from us. She kept her voice low.\n\n\n\n“The tall blonde calls herself Proud Mary. She\nshowed up at the last meeting in a long red dress and a white sweater. A bloody\nmess.” \n\n\n\nTraci had a euphemism for every regular in the\nclub and labeled the newbies if they came back a second time. Whenever she\ncalled me Saint Evelyn my stomach knotted but when she used the epithets that\nshe gave the regulars, I got more nervous. \n\n\n\nBesides Joe, Jennifer and Scary Julie, the ex-priest, there was Sarah the eunuch and Laura the admirer. Cindy was the whiner of the group and Hawk-nose Kaitlyn was the youngest member to regularly attend our meetings. Both she and Cindy were in their late twenties and were rail thin. Traci called them Zeros. I didn’t know it referenced a dress size. I thought she was being derogatory, like all her other labels. \n\n\n\n“Joe calls her Big Kathy,” I said referring to\nthe tall blonde. Traci was unconcerned with what other people thought. I never\nrealized how prejudiced she was towards our own kind.  \n\n\n\n“Like most of these freaks she works in IT and\nis married. Isn’t that Barbie?” \n\n\n\nTraci nodded in the direction of a newbie in a\nwhite dress.\n\n\n\n“No, I don’t think so. She’s Hispanic. Her\neyes are slanted. Barbie had big eyes like the doll, remember. That’s why we\ncalled her that.”\n\n\n\n“Cripes! That’s right. It’s hard to keep track\nof all the freaks. Where do they all come from?” \n\n\n\nJennifer brought\nher finger up to her thin colorless lips. Petite Cindy was in the ‘hot\nseat’ blubbering something about stenosis and an opening the size of a pencil\nnub. She was always crying or feigning emotional trauma to draw sympathy. Her\nlarge dark eyes looked down into her empty lap. Cindy spoke in a\nmonotone-droll-little-girl voice. Her eyes were wide-open and dry. There were\nno tears, but people around her, especially the newbies, feigned empathy as\nthough it was expected of them. \n\n\n\nPeople didn’t\nnormally cry at meetings. Most of our tears were used up long ago as children.\nSelf-pity is unusual for a tranny who survived past puberty. It succumbed to an\nemotional cancer that spread quietly into the trauma of our teen years when we\nnoticed the developing bodies of the girls born in the right body. Pity was\nreplaced by an emptiness and self-loathing before we became adults. \n\n\n\nSome had a chip on their shoulder, but when\nmost first came to the club and realized they were not alone they were elated\nor relieved. No one cried in a meeting unless it was a story about them. How\nshe was molested by a family member or sitting in a warm bath at the age of six\ncontemplating how to cut off the male genitals that did not belong on her body\nwithout bleeding to death.  \n\n\n\nJennifer liked\nCindy for some reason. She often sat in the hot seat. Cindy retold her story\nabout her botched operation by an incompetent Montreal surgeon at almost every\nmeeting. We were the experimental people. Dr. Menard had tried a new spiral\ngrafting procedure to improve on the healing process of the neo-vagina.\nHowever, something went horribly wrong, if you believed Cindy. \n\n\n\n“Cindy is a drama queen,” Traci said. She\nthought Cindy failed to follow directions and insert the prosthetic device into\nthe raw wound twice a day to keep it open until it healed. I pictured the\nlittle girl in The Exorcist stabbing\nher crotch when she said it and winced. Physical pain to pacify our emotional\ntrauma.\n\n\n\n Sarah’s\nhair was cut short like a boy’s but he looked and sounded like a woman because\nhe never went through puberty. He contracted syphilis when he was 9. That’s\nwhen his mother’s boyfriend moved into their trailer. Sarah told me he used to\nsneak into her room at night when her mother passed out from the drugs that he\ngave her. \n\n\n\n“He was a sick man.” \n\n\n\nShe almost\nsounded sorry for him. \n\n\n\nI felt sorry for\nSarah. She didn’t talk much. When she did, it was usually to\ncertain people like me or Laura, who she moved in with when she came up from\nthe New York City. Laura and Sarah were not real members of the XX Club.\nNeither were candidates for sexual reassignment, but Canon Jones let them join\nthe support group whenever they felt like killing themselves.  \n\n\n\nSarah didn’t\nmake eye contact. She usually looked down at her feet when she spoke or at her\nlap if she was sitting. Her voice was low, and you’d have to strain to hear it.\nShe didn’t talk much to the others, but for some reason, she did talk to me. \n\n\n\nEveryone seemed to confide in me and tell me\nthings I did not want to hear, especially Joe. Sometimes people told me too\nmuch—those dirty little secrets that should be locked in a box in the back of a\ncloset or swept under a bed. I kept a smile pressed to my lips and listened and\ntried not to think about how it would affect me. \n\n\n\nFrom meeting to\nmeeting, I barely remembered the ones I saw from the previous month. A handful\nof newbies came and went from time to time, but no one noticed when they didn’t\nshow up again. We were keenly aware that only a handful would make it out alive\nand were relieved when we were still sitting in that imperfect circle of\nchairs. \n\n\n\nOne week several\nnewbies appeared at once. A Konstanz with a “Z” she said,\nthen a Bronwyn, and our hawk-nosed Katlyn paraded in wearing heels and heavy\nmakeup probably for the first time. The more flamboyant monikers revealed a\nchange in attitude among the community as if they were no longer ashamed of\nbeing born odd. They reinvented themselves like children playing in a\nmake-believe world pretending to be something different than they were born—not\nquite a white knight, a soldier, or cowboy but almost always a damsel in\ndistress. \n\n\n\nI didn’t\nknow why anyone would want to be a victim but some of the newbies tended to\nrevel in it like it was their destiny. They came in to challenge the\ngatekeepers, who tried without success to screen them out. The clinic staff\nfound the majority of the support group were these new gender-warriors, many\nalso in need of services. They did not want to change their sex. They\ndisappeared at an alarming rate when they or Canon Jones realized the program\nwas not designed to accommodate them.\n\n\n\nWe turned off\nreality. When someone was missing at the next meeting, we did not ask\nquestions. They could be dead or just decided to revert back to the real world\nand hang up their heels for a while. We never knew. We’d see a newbie sitting\nin a chair where the recently deceased should be and we’d go on acting as\nthough they showed up again—transformed.\n\n\n\nI attended\nseveral meetings, twice a month, while still living at home in Vermont. But as\nthe hormonal therapy progressed, and I began to look and feel differently, I\nknew I had to leave the safety of my home and family if I was to ever become\nthe person, I knew I was meant to be.   \n\n#\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n            __ATA.cmd.push(function() {\n                __ATA.initVideoSlot('atatags-370373-60a7904becf2a', {\n                    sectionId: '370373',\n                    format: 'inread'\n                });\n            });\n        \n    \t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t__ATA.cmd.push(function() {\n\t\t\t\t\t__ATA.initDynamicSlot({\n\t\t\t\t\t\tid: 'atatags-26942-60a7904becf74',\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlocation: 120,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tformFactor: '001',\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlabel: {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttext: 'Advertisements',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\tcreative: {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\treportAd: {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttext: 'Report this ad',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tprivacySettings: {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttext: 'Privacy',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\t\t});\n\t\t\tShare this:ShareTweetEmailPrintShare on TumblrLike this:Like Loading...\n\n\tRelated\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\tPosted byFyrecurlSeptember 29, 2019October 4, 2019Posted inExcerpt, Feminist, Gender issues, LGBTQ, Memoir, non-fiction, Trans women, Women and SocietyTags:biography, cultural, diversity, DSM-V, gender dysphoria, Indy writer, Psychology, She-Male, Transsexual\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tPublished by Fyrecurl\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tSingle, White, Female, Over 50 years of age, Juris Doctor, Masters in non-fiction writing, perpetual student of life;\t\t\n\t\t\tView more posts\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\n",

  "inline_text": "By Matt Flick | October 29, 2020 \n Burp Suite has been my favorite web app testing tool for a while and seems like it keeps getting better with age \u0026 updates. Typically, I have avoided using other tools to parse the Burp output (xml) because most of what we report comes from manual testing. Somewhat recently, I started using extensions to add the manual testing results to Burp and thus it made sense to write a script to parse Burp xml output. Say hello to “breathmint”. \n In a similar fashion to nepali, breathmint parses one or more .xml files and produces a spreadsheet (Excel format) as output. Some of the functions in nepali were extracted, modified, and expanded into their own python scripts that breathmint uses: “excelsify.py” and “make_me_pretty.py”. See code for details, including a few comments discussing possible customizations. By default, there are two worksheets in the workbook output file: \n The script runs with python 3. It takes the following options: \n A few notes of the “-e” and “-i” options: \n breathmint, excelsify, and make_me_pretty use the following Python modules that are not typically included with the base installation: \n Parse all burp files in the current working directory, \n include all risk ratings, \n produce an output file named “combined_output–parsed–(YYYYMMDD_HHMM).xlsx” \n Parse all burp files in the ~/Documents/burp/output/ directory, \n include only Critical, High, and Medium rated issues (exclude Low and Informational issues), \n produce an output file named “burp-output–parsed–(YYYYMMDD_HHMM).xlsx” \n Parse all burp files in the current working directory, \n include only Critical, High, and Medium rated issues (exclude Low and Informational issues), \n produce an output file named “just_critical_high_medium–parsed–(YYYYMMDD_HHMM).xlsx” \n Parse the file named “some_burp_file.xml” in the current working directory, \n include only Critical and High rated issues (exclude Medium, Low, and Informational issues), \n produce an output file named “some_burp_file–parsed–(YYYYMMDD_HHMM).xlsx”. \n When breathmint is executed with a single file input and no -o option, it will use the input filename as the base output filename (same as using the -d option but only one Burp xml file is found). \n breathmint will always append the string “–parsed–(YYYYMMDD_HHMM).xlsx” to every output file name (set in the code, so change it there if you want something else), which is defined the the main function. The timestamp (“YYYYMMDD_HHSS”) is also generated in the main function. \n breathmint github repo \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\tcontact@fyrmassociates.com\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n Copyright 2008-2021 FYRM Associates, Inc. \n \n            \n                    \n                      Services \n                    \n                      \n                        Security Testing\n                      \n                        Compliance \u0026 Risk\n                      \n                        AppTrust Training\n                      \n                    \n                    \n                   \n Security Testing \n Compliance \u0026 Risk \n AppTrust Training \n \n                    \n                    Tools\n                    \n                   \n \n                    \n                    Blog\n                    \n                   \n \n                    \n                    Careers\n                    \n                   \n \n                    \n                    About\n                    \n                   \n \n                    \n                    Contact\n                    \n                   \n Burp Issues - results from the Burp xml file(s).

  "inline_text": "Sprinklers are the best way to fight the fire at initial stage, as it detects as well as extinguishes the fire, thus helping in further spreading of the fire. They are always connected to wet riser. When the sprinkler senses the hot gases from fire, each sprinkler head will open and spray water on to a fire. Only the sprinklers over the fire open. The others remain closed. This limits any damage to areas where there is no fire and reduces the amount of water needed. The flow is calculated so that there is always enough to control a fire taking into account the size and construction of the building .\n              Home\n             \n \n              Profile\n             \n \n              Products\n              \n                \n                  \n                    Fire Extinguishers\n                    Fire Equipments\n                    Fire Alarm System\n                    Fire Hydrant System\n                    Sprinkler\n                    Signages\n                  \n                \n              \n             \n Fire Extinguishers \n Fire Equipments \n Fire Alarm System \n Fire Hydrant System \n Sprinkler \n Signages \n \n              Services\n             \n \n              Clients\n             \n \n              Contact Us\n             \n Sprinkler pendant type 68 °C. \n Sprinklers (Side Wall) \n Flexible Sprinkler Drops \n Concealed sprinklers (white) \n Roset Plate (White) \n Rosette Plate (Chrome)",

  "inline_text": "\n \n The best way to use SQLite is to embed it in the game using the recommended amalgamation source code available on sqlite.org, but it is also available as a library for Windows (DLL) or Linux (shared-library .so ) . \n From a licensing point of view, using SQLite in any commercial game is also VERY safe since SQLite’s source has been released into the public domain. \n The following steps should allow C++ programmers to embed SQLite into their games. \n  \n Step 1 \n Go to http://www.sqlite.org and click on Download and grab  a file named sqlite-amalgamation-X_X_X.zip where the X’s are replaced by the appropriate version number. In my case I downloaded sqlite-amalgamation-3_7_0.zip (Windows) or sqlite-amalgamation-3.7.0.tar.gz (Linux) \n  \n  \n Step 2Extract the downloaded file and add the sqlite3.h and sqlite3.c files to the project. The size of the sqlite3.c file should be really big, around 3.96MB. \n Step 3Compile sqlite3.c in order to create a object file for it. The object file should be around 1.09MB. \n Step 4Include the sqlite3.h file in the game’s c++ files. For demonstration purposes I created a main.cpp file that looks as follows: \n #include \u003cstdio.h\u003e#include \u003ccstdlib\u003e#include \"sqlite3/sqlite3.h\"#include \u003cstring\u003eusing namespace std;int main(void){sqlite3 *db;char *zErrMsg = 0;int rc;string q = \"\";string dbName = \"game.dat\";//Attempt to open database. If it does not exist create it.rc = sqlite3_open(dbName.c_str(), \u0026db);if( rc ){fprintf(stderr, \"Can't open database: %s\\n\", sqlite3_errmsg(db));sqlite3_close(db);exit(1);}//Set query to executeq = \"\";sqlite3_close(db); //Always close db when done with itreturn 0;} \n Compile and run. There should now be a file called game.dat in the debug directory since SQLite will create the database file by default if it is not found. \n Step 5Since it is now possible to create a database it is time to create some tables. For demonstration purposes I created 2 tables. t_type and t_assets. \n  \n  \n  \n The Types table will simply contain information about various types of assets. The table will consist of an id for identification purposes, a parent id in order to be able to create a tree hierarchy and a title for what type it is, e.g. weapon, vehicle, npc, etc… \n The Assets table will contain information about a specific asset such as an image file or 3d object. The table consist of an id, a type id, src or location of the asset, title or name of the asset and a description.  E.g. Image of a “Toyota Bakkie” that is located at /assests/vehicles/toyota.png with the description:”A Red 4×4 Toyota Bakkie”. \n In order to execute queries on the database the sqlite3_exec function will be used. The code to do that follows: \n //Set query to executeq = \"CREATE TABLE t_type\"\"(\"\"'ID' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\"\"'PARENT_ID' INTEGER,\"\"'TITLE' TEXT\" \");\"\"CREATE TABLE t_assets\"\"(\"\"'ID' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\"\"'TYPE_ID' INTEGER,\"\"'SRC' TEXT,\"\"'TITLE' TEXT,\"\"'DESCRIPTION' TEXT\"\");\";rc = sqlite3_exec(db, q.c_str(), NULL, 0, \u0026zErrMsg);if( rc!=SQLITE_OK ){fprintf(stderr, \"SQL error: %s\\n\", zErrMsg);sqlite3_free(zErrMsg);} \n  \n Note that I do not test whether a table actually exist, maybe you can add that to your code as a bit of an exercise? \n Step 6It is now time to insert some data. The query to do that follows: \n q = \"INSERT INTO t_type('PARENT_ID','TITLE') VALUES (0,'VEHICLES');\"\"INSERT INTO t_type('PARENT_ID','TITLE') VALUES (0,'ANIMALS');\"\"INSERT INTO t_assets('TYPE_ID','SRC','TITLE','DESCRIPTION') VALUES (1,'/assets/vechicles/toyota.png','A Red 4x4 Toyota Bakkie');\"\"INSERT INTO t_assets('TYPE_ID','SRC','TITLE','DESCRIPTION') VALUES (1,'/assets/vechicles/ferrari.png','A twin-turbo F50 Ferrari, like the one John Carmack drives');\"\"INSERT INTO t_assets('TYPE_ID','SRC','TITLE','DESCRIPTION') VALUES (2,'/assets/vechicles/munky.png','A munky. It is a bloody munky');\"; \n  \n You can of course do more advanced stuff like getting the ID of the types and then use that in the query. \n A Fast way to check the data in the file is to open it with notepad or notepad++ to check the results; but I will not recommend that approach with big files. \n Step 7In order to query the data, a callback function needs to be declared. The declaration for that looks as follows: \n static int callback(void*, int, char**, char**); \n  \n  \n This callback function will be called for each row returned from the query. \n The first parameter of this function is not really used.The second parameter contains the number of columns.The third parameter is an array containing the value of each column as a char*.The Fourth and last parameter contains the Names of each column. \n An example callback function follows: \n static int callback(void *NotUsed, int argc, char **argv, char **azColName){int i;for(i=0; i\u003cargc; i++){printf(\"%s = %s\\n\", azColName[i], argv[i] ? argv[i] : \"NULL\");}printf(\"\\n\");return 0;} \n  \n And this is how it will be used: \n q = \"SELECT * FROM t_assets WHERE TYPE_ID=1;\";rc = sqlite3_exec(db, q.c_str(), callback, 0, \u0026zErrMsg);if( rc!=SQLITE_OK ){fprintf(stderr, \"SQL error: %s\\n\", zErrMsg);sqlite3_free(zErrMsg);} \n Expected Output: \n  \n And that is it..The full source code for main.cpp looks as follows: \n  \n #include \u003cstdio.h\u003e#include \u003cconio.h\u003e#include \u003ccstdlib\u003e#include \"sqlite3/sqlite3.h\"#include \u003cstring\u003e \n using namespace std;  \n static int callback(void *NotUsed, int argc, char **argv, char **azColName){   \n  int i;   \n  for(i=0; i\u003cargc; i++){  printf(\"%s = %s\\n\", azColName[i], argv[i] ? argv[i] : \"NULL\");  }   \n  printf(\"\\n\");  return 0;}  \n int main(void){ sqlite3 *db;    char *zErrMsg = 0;    int rc;    string q = \"\";    string dbName = \"game.dat\";      \n  //Attempt to open database.

  "inline_text": "Common Course of Study (CCS) - Learn all about the CCS and how it can be used to inform your course selections during your 4 years at Lafaytte College.  \n Why is this important for course selection? \n We want you to consider all of your academic options; however, some academic programs—particularly engineering and the natural sciences—are highly structured, with required foundational courses in the first year. \n As a Lafayette College student you will have 4 years at the college to complete the common course of study. Do not stress yourself out about it too much, but you should take the time to understand the requirements as you decide on classes throughout your time at the college. \n Make sure you fully understand your options so that you can make an informed decision about courses. Consult with a class dean, faculty department head, or a PARDner  if you have questions. \n For students interested in the health professions, please review the course requirements. \n First-Year Seminar, taken in the fall semester of the first year, is designed to introduce students to intellectual inquiry by engaging them as thinkers, speakers, and writers. We recommend that you choose topics of interest to you, regardless of your intended academic major. You will be asked to rank your first five preferences from the FYS course list. \n Natural Sciences requirement, requires either: (1) two Natural Science with lab (NS) courses or, (2) one Natural Science w/lab and one Natural Science with (STSC). \n Many 100-level NS courses are only open to first or second year students (Geology and Psychology courses for example). Also, students must take an NS course with lab as a prerequisite to enrolling in a course with a STSC designation. Therefore, first-year students are encouraged to consider registering for a course having a NS designation during their first year. \n Quantitative reasoning requirement, one course in which students learn to use mathematical methods to solve problems, represent and interpret quantitative information, and critically analyze mathematical results (Q). \n Most students will fulfill this requirement by taking an introductory course in mathematics. \n In many majors, students are required to take one or more mathematics courses to complete the requirements of the major. If you are interested in, or think you might be interested in one of those majors, you should follow department recommendations to take a mathematics course appropriate to that major in your first semester. \n All entering students are required to complete a short online Mathematics Survey and the online Mathematics Placement Test A. Students considering calculus classes might also take the online Mathematics Placement Test B and Mathematics Placement Test C. \n Read the full Mathematics Survey and Mathematics Placement Test instructions \n A writing requirement, to be satisfied through the First-Year Seminar and three additional W-designated courses that use process writing methods with at least one course in the major and at least one course outside the major (W). \n Global and multiculturalism, requiring the completion of two courses that examine the structure of identity, diversity, and differences in domestic and global contexts (GM1 and GM2). \n Values requirement, to be satisfied by a course where students construct and evaluate answers to questions of moral and political concern (V). \n Elementary proficiency in a second language requires the successful completion of a year of college-level study of a language or demonstration of equivalent proficiency. Students may be exempted via advanced placement credit (a score of 3 or better on an AP language exam) or other Lafayette-approved forms of standardized testing (a passing score on TOEFL for international students; score of 500 or above on the appropriate SAT 2 language test). \n You can find out more about the Common Course of Study here.\n\t\t\t\n\t\tAbout Us\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tLafayette at a Glance\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tMission \u0026 History\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOur Values\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tInspired Leadership\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWhy Not?\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tLafayette at a Glance\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tMission \u0026 History\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tOur Values\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tInspired Leadership\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tWhy Not?\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\tAcademics\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDepartments \u0026 Programs\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOur Faculty\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCurriculum Offerings\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCollege Catalog\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tLibrary\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAcademic Support\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAcademic Calendar\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tDepartments \u0026 Programs\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tOur Faculty\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tCurriculum Offerings\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tCollege Catalog\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tLibrary\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tAcademic Support\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tAcademic Calendar\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\tCampus Life\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tLiving on Campus\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tClubs \u0026 Organizations\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThe Arts\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAthletics\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDiversity \u0026 Inclusion\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSustainability\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tTraditions\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAbout Easton\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tLiving on Campus\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tClubs \u0026 Organizations\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tThe Arts\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tAthletics\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tDiversity \u0026 Inclusion\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tSustainability\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tTraditions\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tAbout Easton\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\tAdmissions \u0026 Aid\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tWhat We Look For\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tAdmissions Visits\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tHow to Apply\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tCollege Costs\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tFinancial Aid\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tDeadlines and Forms\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tMeet Our Team\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tPolicies\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tWhat We Look For\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tAdmissions Visits\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tHow to Apply\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tCollege Costs\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tFinancial Aid\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tDeadlines and Forms\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tMeet Our Team\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\tPolicies\n\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\tAthletics\n\n\t\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\tThe Arts\n\n\t\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\tNews\n\n\t\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\tEvents\n\n\t\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\tGiving\n\n\t\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\tStudents\n\n\t\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\tFaculty \u0026 Staff\n\n\t\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\tFamilies\n\n\t\t\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\tAlumni\n\n\t\t\t\t \n First Semester Course Selectio…\t \n Course Selection Resources\t\t \n The Common Course of Study \n First Semester Course Selection Preferences\n\n\tMessage from Class Dean\n\tPlacement Exams\n\tExplore Majors \u0026 Programs\n\tExplore the First Year Seminar\n\tExplore Fall Course Offerings\n\tCourse Selection Resources\n\t\n\t\tThe Common Course of Study\n\t\tAP \u0026 IB Credits\n\t\n\n\tSubmit Your Course Selections\n\tResources for International Students\n\tFAQ\n\n \n Message from Class Dean \n Placement Exams \n Explore Majors \u0026 Programs \n Explore the First Year Seminar \n Explore Fall Course Offerings \n Course Selection Resources\n\t\n\t\tThe Common Course of Study\n\t\tAP \u0026 IB Credits\n\t\n \n The Common Course of Study \n AP \u0026 IB Credits \n Submit Your Course Selections \n Resources for International Students \n FAQ",

In addition to these products, we undertake servicing for various systems that are as follows \n If your fire extinguishers needs painting, contact fyregard to get the painting done or if the fire extinguisher needs to be labelled, Fyregard undertakes painting and labeling services for fire extinguishers. \n Fire extinguishers should be Hydraulic Pressure Tested (a process called hydrostatic testing) after 3 years to ensure that the cylinder is safe to use. \n CO2 Fire extinguishers should be Hydraulic Pressure Tested (a process called hydrostatic testing) after 5 years to ensure that the cylinder is safe to use. \n Fire extinguisher servicing will give you peace of mind. In a business you are required to have an extinguisher present on the premises at all times. Regular fire extinguisher servicing will guarantee that your equipment is in proper working order. Fire extinguisher servicing, can help to keep a fire at bay until the professionals arrive on the scene. Fire extinguishers should be serviced at regular intervals (at least once a year), or when specifically indicated by an inspection. Servicing is a \"thorough check\" of the extinguisher. It is intended to give maximum assurance that an extinguisher will operate effectively and safely. It includes a thorough examination and any necessary repair, recharging or replacement. It will normally reveal the need for hydrostatic testing of an extinguisher. \n You depend on your fire detection and alarm systems to provide the earliest possible warning of a fire for your staff and visitors. It has been installed to protect life, as well as property and will, when required, be expected to operate correctly in an emergency.  So it makes sense that your fire hydrant system is is serviced regurlarly and kept in optimum condition. \n Fire alarm systems are expected to help protect people, property, and assets. But you can’t tell if they’re fully operational just by looking at them. As with any other system, electronics and other components can degrade over time and compromise the system’s operation. Dust, dirt, and other contaminants can cause problems with smoke detectors. Such things as vandalism, remodeling, and improper maintenance procedures can also damage fire protection equipment. The good news is that with proper testing, inspection, and maintenance from fyregard you can keep your fire alarm system at optimum operating performance.\n              Home\n             \n \n              Profile\n             \n \n              Products\n              \n                \n                  \n                    Fire Extinguishers\n                    Fire Equipments\n                    Fire Alarm System\n                    Fire Hydrant System\n                    Sprinkler\n                    Signages\n                  \n                \n              \n             \n Fire Extinguishers \n Fire Equipments \n Fire Alarm System \n Fire Hydrant System \n Sprinkler \n Signages \n \n              Services\n             \n \n              Clients\n             \n \n              Contact Us\n             \n ABC Type - ABC Type 1/2/5/10 kg. capacity \n DCP Type - DCP Type 5 Kgs, 10 Kgs, 25 Kgs and 50 Kgs capacity \n CO2 Type - CO2 Type 2 Kgs. and 4.5 Kgs, 9 Kgs, 22.2 Kgs and 45 Kgs capacity \n W/CO2 Type - W/CO2 Type 9 ltrs  and 45 ltrs capacity \n Mechanical Foam - M/Foam Type 9 ltrs and 45 ltrs capacity",

During that time, I volunteered at the Thurston County Dispute Resolution Center, as a phone conciliator and eventually a mediator.

  "inline_text": "\n \n The best way to use SQLite is to embed it in the game using the recommended amalgamation source code available on sqlite.org, but it is also available as a library for Windows (DLL) or Linux (shared-library .so ) . \n From a licensing point of view, using SQLite in any commercial game is also VERY safe since SQLite’s source has been released into the public domain. \n The following steps should allow C++ programmers to embed SQLite into their games. \n  \n Step 1 \n Go to http://www.sqlite.org and click on Download and grab  a file named sqlite-amalgamation-X_X_X.zip where the X’s are replaced by the appropriate version number. In my case I downloaded sqlite-amalgamation-3_7_0.zip (Windows) or sqlite-amalgamation-3.7.0.tar.gz (Linux) \n  \n  \n Step 2Extract the downloaded file and add the sqlite3.h and sqlite3.c files to the project. The size of the sqlite3.c file should be really big, around 3.96MB. \n Step 3Compile sqlite3.c in order to create a object file for it. The object file should be around 1.09MB. \n Step 4Include the sqlite3.h file in the game’s c++ files. For demonstration purposes I created a main.cpp file that looks as follows: \n #include \u003cstdio.h\u003e#include \u003ccstdlib\u003e#include \"sqlite3/sqlite3.h\"#include \u003cstring\u003eusing namespace std;int main(void){sqlite3 *db;char *zErrMsg = 0;int rc;string q = \"\";string dbName = \"game.dat\";//Attempt to open database. If it does not exist create it.rc = sqlite3_open(dbName.c_str(), \u0026db);if( rc ){fprintf(stderr, \"Can't open database: %s\\n\", sqlite3_errmsg(db));sqlite3_close(db);exit(1);}//Set query to executeq = \"\";sqlite3_close(db); //Always close db when done with itreturn 0;} \n Compile and run. There should now be a file called game.dat in the debug directory since SQLite will create the database file by default if it is not found. \n Step 5Since it is now possible to create a database it is time to create some tables. For demonstration purposes I created 2 tables. t_type and t_assets. \n  \n  \n  \n The Types table will simply contain information about various types of assets. The table will consist of an id for identification purposes, a parent id in order to be able to create a tree hierarchy and a title for what type it is, e.g. weapon, vehicle, npc, etc… \n The Assets table will contain information about a specific asset such as an image file or 3d object. The table consist of an id, a type id, src or location of the asset, title or name of the asset and a description.  E.g. Image of a “Toyota Bakkie” that is located at /assests/vehicles/toyota.png with the description:”A Red 4×4 Toyota Bakkie”. \n In order to execute queries on the database the sqlite3_exec function will be used. The code to do that follows: \n //Set query to executeq = \"CREATE TABLE t_type\"\"(\"\"'ID' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\"\"'PARENT_ID' INTEGER,\"\"'TITLE' TEXT\" \");\"\"CREATE TABLE t_assets\"\"(\"\"'ID' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\"\"'TYPE_ID' INTEGER,\"\"'SRC' TEXT,\"\"'TITLE' TEXT,\"\"'DESCRIPTION' TEXT\"\");\";rc = sqlite3_exec(db, q.c_str(), NULL, 0, \u0026zErrMsg);if( rc!=SQLITE_OK ){fprintf(stderr, \"SQL error: %s\\n\", zErrMsg);sqlite3_free(zErrMsg);} \n  \n Note that I do not test whether a table actually exist, maybe you can add that to your code as a bit of an exercise? \n Step 6It is now time to insert some data. The query to do that follows: \n q = \"INSERT INTO t_type('PARENT_ID','TITLE') VALUES (0,'VEHICLES');\"\"INSERT INTO t_type('PARENT_ID','TITLE') VALUES (0,'ANIMALS');\"\"INSERT INTO t_assets('TYPE_ID','SRC','TITLE','DESCRIPTION') VALUES (1,'/assets/vechicles/toyota.png','A Red 4x4 Toyota Bakkie');\"\"INSERT INTO t_assets('TYPE_ID','SRC','TITLE','DESCRIPTION') VALUES (1,'/assets/vechicles/ferrari.png','A twin-turbo F50 Ferrari, like the one John Carmack drives');\"\"INSERT INTO t_assets('TYPE_ID','SRC','TITLE','DESCRIPTION') VALUES (2,'/assets/vechicles/munky.png','A munky. It is a bloody munky');\"; \n  \n You can of course do more advanced stuff like getting the ID of the types and then use that in the query. \n A Fast way to check the data in the file is to open it with notepad or notepad++ to check the results; but I will not recommend that approach with big files. \n Step 7In order to query the data, a callback function needs to be declared. The declaration for that looks as follows: \n static int callback(void*, int, char**, char**); \n  \n  \n This callback function will be called for each row returned from the query. \n The first parameter of this function is not really used.The second parameter contains the number of columns.The third parameter is an array containing the value of each column as a char*.The Fourth and last parameter contains the Names of each column. \n An example callback function follows: \n static int callback(void *NotUsed, int argc, char **argv, char **azColName){int i;for(i=0; i\u003cargc; i++){printf(\"%s = %s\\n\", azColName[i], argv[i] ? argv[i] : \"NULL\");}printf(\"\\n\");return 0;} \n  \n And this is how it will be used: \n q = \"SELECT * FROM t_assets WHERE TYPE_ID=1;\";rc = sqlite3_exec(db, q.c_str(), callback, 0, \u0026zErrMsg);if( rc!=SQLITE_OK ){fprintf(stderr, \"SQL error: %s\\n\", zErrMsg);sqlite3_free(zErrMsg);} \n Expected Output: \n  \n And that is it..The full source code for main.cpp looks as follows: \n  \n #include \u003cstdio.h\u003e#include \u003cconio.h\u003e#include \u003ccstdlib\u003e#include \"sqlite3/sqlite3.h\"#include \u003cstring\u003e \n using namespace std;  \n static int callback(void *NotUsed, int argc, char **argv, char **azColName){   \n  int i;   \n  for(i=0; i\u003cargc; i++){  printf(\"%s = %s\\n\", azColName[i], argv[i] ? argv[i] : \"NULL\");  }   \n  printf(\"\\n\");  return 0;}  \n int main(void){ sqlite3 *db;    char *zErrMsg = 0;    int rc;    string q = \"\";    string dbName = \"game.dat\";      \n  //Attempt to open database.

  "inline_text": " \n Call Showroom \n  \n Call Service \n  \n Send Message \n Whether constructing a home, remodeling, or looking for some added character to a room, a wood fireplace is the perfect addition. Wood burning fireplaces increase the value of your home, greatly increase heat efficiency, and become the centerpiece of any room. When deciding which wood fireplace to have installed in your home, please stop by our showroom in Fort Collins, CO to see first-hand all that FyrePro has to offer, and enjoy the warmth and comfort that a crackling wood fireplace can bring to your home. \n FyrePro is locally owned and operated with a large selection of wood fireplaces available to not only fit in with your existing décor but also be highly efficient, and we serve customers throughout Colorado and Wyoming. \n Our EPA approved fireplaces are energy efficient and can help save on your energy bill. High-efficiency fireplaces provide the means to provide heat for your home that is less expensive than electric heat. Wood burning fireplaces are now highly efficient and you will not lose most of the heat up through the chimney like older, more ineffective models. This is due to their new engineering technology that allows wood burning fireplaces to keep the heat where you want it: your home. \n Our fireplaces are approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) meaning they either meet or exceed clean air standards. Owing to the increased efficiency of newer wood fireplaces, less wood is needed since as much heat as possible is conserved due to their improved design. This means a smaller carbon footprint is left behind. This is a benefit not only to the environment but your wallet as well. \n If you think you are lacking the space in which to have a wood fireplace, think again! Zero-clearance wood fireplaces are just the solution you need. Consisting of a firebox surrounded by an insulated shell, zero-clearance fireplaces are very flexible in their installation and can fit into many locations that would be unfeasible for a masonry fireplace. Manufactured to be well-insulated, these appliances can be installed next to combustible materials as these units must pass very strict operating standards. Overall, zero-clearance fireplaces offer high safety, energy efficiency and a great performance that will provide heat and ambiance to your home for years to come. \n \nName\n\n \n \nEmail Address\n\n \n \nMessage\n\n \n 4631 S.

Wood burning fireplaces increase the value of your home, greatly increase heat efficiency, and become the centerpiece of any room. When deciding which wood fireplace to have installed in your home, please stop by our showroom in Fort Collins, CO to see first-hand all that FyrePro has to offer, and enjoy the warmth and comfort that a crackling wood fireplace can bring to your home.\nFyrePro is locally owned and operated with a large selection of wood fireplaces available to not only fit in with your existing décor but also be highly efficient, and we serve customers throughout Colorado and Wyoming.\nEnhanced Efficiency\nOur EPA approved fireplaces are energy efficient and can help save on your energy bill. High-efficiency fireplaces provide the means to provide heat for your home that is less expensive than electric heat. Wood burning fireplaces are now highly efficient and you will not lose most of the heat up through the chimney like older, more ineffective models. This is due to their new engineering technology that allows wood burning fireplaces to keep the heat where you want it: your home.\nEnvironmentally Friendly\nOur fireplaces are approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) meaning they either meet or exceed clean air standards. Owing to the increased efficiency of newer wood fireplaces, less wood is needed since as much heat as possible is conserved due to their improved design. This means a smaller carbon footprint is left behind. This is a benefit not only to the environment but your wallet as well.\n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\nZero-Clearance Fireplaces\nIf you think you are lacking the space in which to have a wood fireplace, think again! Zero-clearance wood fireplaces are just the solution you need. Consisting of a firebox surrounded by an insulated shell, zero-clearance fireplaces are very flexible in their installation and can fit into many locations that would be unfeasible for a masonry fireplace. Manufactured to be well-insulated, these appliances can be installed next to combustible materials as these units must pass very strict operating standards. Overall, zero-clearance fireplaces offer high safety, energy efficiency and a great performance that will provide heat and ambiance to your home for years to come.\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nOur fireplace experts can help you determine the best wood fireplace for your needs. We serve homeowners in Fort Collins CO, Loveland, Westminster, Laramie WY, Thornton, Cheyenne WY, Broomfield, Glen Hvaen, Bellvue, Livermore, and all towns \u0026 communities in Boulder County, Weld County, and Larimer County.\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nMessage Us\nGet in touch below.

  "inline_text": "All foods are not created equal!  \n Below are ten power packed foods designed to give you energy, vitality and all around good health! Try these super foods to get started on the right foot.   \n  1. Beans – Beans of all kinds (kidney, navy, lentils, chickpeas, Northern) are high in plant protein and low in fat, carbs and calories.  If fiber is a problem in your diet, eating a healthy portion of beans each day can keep your digestive system healthy. \n  2. Oatmeal – Oatmeal is a filling grain that also provides much needed fiber to keep hunger at bay and your blood sugar constant. \n  3. Fruits – Fruits are filled with antioxidants such as Vitamin C and A.  Antioxidants fight free radical damage in the body and reduce the risk of cancer.  The antioxidants in fruit boost the immune system to fight the effects of aging in the body. \n  4. Allium foods – This class of foods includes garlic, onions, leeks and shallots.  Allium vegetables help guard the body against the risk of cancer and many other ailments and some are known for lowering cholesterol.  They also help lower blood pressure and prevent blood clots.  Eating these power packed vegetables in their natural state especially garlic increases their health benefits.  \n  5. Salmon – Salmon is rich in protein and in omega-3 fatty acids which reduces the risk of heart disease and other conditions. Wild salmon is a fatty fish but it contains good fats proven to improve health in children and adults.  \n  6. Flax seed – Like salmon it contains omega-3 fatty acids.  These seeds also contain omega-6 and omega-9 fatty acids.  You get a lot of power to fight high cholesterol, heart disease and diabetes with this seed.  \n  7. Peppers – Peppers contain antioxidants like beta-carotene and Vitamin C.  Peppers range from mild and sweet to so hot you’ll be calling the fire department.  All peppers contain a substance called capsaicin.  Capsaicin has the properties of an anti-inflammatory, a pain reliever, lowers cancer risk and heart disease.  \n  8. Nuts and seeds – Nuts are high in fat but those fats are the good kind.  Peanuts, almonds, Brazil nuts, walnuts and pistachios are all providers of good fats and protein.  Nuts help to lower cholesterol.  Eat them right out of the shell with no additives. \n  9. Açai – This berry has become the media darling of the health and food industry as of late.  It is rich in antioxidants and increases energy.  You can get more done and look better while doing it.  \n 10. Yogurt – The fat free variety is good for you.  Yogurt contains calcium, Vitamin B, and protein.  If you don’t drink milk, yogurt is an alternative to get your calcium in to build strong bones and teeth.  Live yogurt also contains friendly bacteria to help promote a healthy digestive system. \n Okay so perhaps you won’t grow rich from eating a healthier diet.  However, building a better healthier body begins with what you eat and if you are choosing and eating the right foods perhaps one day you will wake up and find yourself on the cover of a magazine, your quality of your life improved as well as your life expectancy, therefore giving you more time to work on becoming rich, So maybe you can Eat and Grow Rich.  There is only one way to find out.   How about oat crusted salmon with a fennel and leek white bean stew for dinner? \n ~ by Mel's Boy on Tuesday, 23 June 2009. \n Posted in Uncategorized\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in: \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your WordPress.com account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t( Log Out / \n\t\t\t\tChange )\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your Google account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t( Log Out / \n\t\t\t\tChange )\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your Twitter account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t( Log Out / \n\t\t\t\tChange )\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tYou are commenting using your Facebook account.\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t( Log Out / \n\t\t\t\tChange )\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t \n Connecting to %s \n  Notify me of new comments via email. \n  Notify me of new posts via email. \n  \n\n \n  \n Blog at WordPress.com.

  "inline_text": "\n \n The best way to use SQLite is to embed it in the game using the recommended amalgamation source code available on sqlite.org, but it is also available as a library for Windows (DLL) or Linux (shared-library .so ) . \n From a licensing point of view, using SQLite in any commercial game is also VERY safe since SQLite’s source has been released into the public domain. \n The following steps should allow C++ programmers to embed SQLite into their games. \n  \n Step 1 \n Go to http://www.sqlite.org and click on Download and grab  a file named sqlite-amalgamation-X_X_X.zip where the X’s are replaced by the appropriate version number. In my case I downloaded sqlite-amalgamation-3_7_0.zip (Windows) or sqlite-amalgamation-3.7.0.tar.gz (Linux) \n  \n  \n Step 2Extract the downloaded file and add the sqlite3.h and sqlite3.c files to the project. The size of the sqlite3.c file should be really big, around 3.96MB. \n Step 3Compile sqlite3.c in order to create a object file for it. The object file should be around 1.09MB. \n Step 4Include the sqlite3.h file in the game’s c++ files. For demonstration purposes I created a main.cpp file that looks as follows: \n #include \u003cstdio.h\u003e#include \u003ccstdlib\u003e#include \"sqlite3/sqlite3.h\"#include \u003cstring\u003eusing namespace std;int main(void){sqlite3 *db;char *zErrMsg = 0;int rc;string q = \"\";string dbName = \"game.dat\";//Attempt to open database. If it does not exist create it.rc = sqlite3_open(dbName.c_str(), \u0026db);if( rc ){fprintf(stderr, \"Can't open database: %s\\n\", sqlite3_errmsg(db));sqlite3_close(db);exit(1);}//Set query to executeq = \"\";sqlite3_close(db); //Always close db when done with itreturn 0;} \n Compile and run. There should now be a file called game.dat in the debug directory since SQLite will create the database file by default if it is not found. \n Step 5Since it is now possible to create a database it is time to create some tables. For demonstration purposes I created 2 tables. t_type and t_assets. \n  \n  \n  \n The Types table will simply contain information about various types of assets. The table will consist of an id for identification purposes, a parent id in order to be able to create a tree hierarchy and a title for what type it is, e.g. weapon, vehicle, npc, etc… \n The Assets table will contain information about a specific asset such as an image file or 3d object. The table consist of an id, a type id, src or location of the asset, title or name of the asset and a description.  E.g. Image of a “Toyota Bakkie” that is located at /assests/vehicles/toyota.png with the description:”A Red 4×4 Toyota Bakkie”. \n In order to execute queries on the database the sqlite3_exec function will be used. The code to do that follows: \n //Set query to executeq = \"CREATE TABLE t_type\"\"(\"\"'ID' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\"\"'PARENT_ID' INTEGER,\"\"'TITLE' TEXT\" \");\"\"CREATE TABLE t_assets\"\"(\"\"'ID' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\"\"'TYPE_ID' INTEGER,\"\"'SRC' TEXT,\"\"'TITLE' TEXT,\"\"'DESCRIPTION' TEXT\"\");\";rc = sqlite3_exec(db, q.c_str(), NULL, 0, \u0026zErrMsg);if( rc!=SQLITE_OK ){fprintf(stderr, \"SQL error: %s\\n\", zErrMsg);sqlite3_free(zErrMsg);} \n  \n Note that I do not test whether a table actually exist, maybe you can add that to your code as a bit of an exercise? \n Step 6It is now time to insert some data. The query to do that follows: \n q = \"INSERT INTO t_type('PARENT_ID','TITLE') VALUES (0,'VEHICLES');\"\"INSERT INTO t_type('PARENT_ID','TITLE') VALUES (0,'ANIMALS');\"\"INSERT INTO t_assets('TYPE_ID','SRC','TITLE','DESCRIPTION') VALUES (1,'/assets/vechicles/toyota.png','A Red 4x4 Toyota Bakkie');\"\"INSERT INTO t_assets('TYPE_ID','SRC','TITLE','DESCRIPTION') VALUES (1,'/assets/vechicles/ferrari.png','A twin-turbo F50 Ferrari, like the one John Carmack drives');\"\"INSERT INTO t_assets('TYPE_ID','SRC','TITLE','DESCRIPTION') VALUES (2,'/assets/vechicles/munky.png','A munky. It is a bloody munky');\"; \n  \n You can of course do more advanced stuff like getting the ID of the types and then use that in the query. \n A Fast way to check the data in the file is to open it with notepad or notepad++ to check the results; but I will not recommend that approach with big files. \n Step 7In order to query the data, a callback function needs to be declared. The declaration for that looks as follows: \n static int callback(void*, int, char**, char**); \n  \n  \n This callback function will be called for each row returned from the query. \n The first parameter of this function is not really used.The second parameter contains the number of columns.The third parameter is an array containing the value of each column as a char*.The Fourth and last parameter contains the Names of each column. \n An example callback function follows: \n static int callback(void *NotUsed, int argc, char **argv, char **azColName){int i;for(i=0; i\u003cargc; i++){printf(\"%s = %s\\n\", azColName[i], argv[i] ? argv[i] : \"NULL\");}printf(\"\\n\");return 0;} \n  \n And this is how it will be used: \n q = \"SELECT * FROM t_assets WHERE TYPE_ID=1;\";rc = sqlite3_exec(db, q.c_str(), callback, 0, \u0026zErrMsg);if( rc!=SQLITE_OK ){fprintf(stderr, \"SQL error: %s\\n\", zErrMsg);sqlite3_free(zErrMsg);} \n Expected Output: \n  \n And that is it..The full source code for main.cpp looks as follows: \n  \n #include \u003cstdio.h\u003e#include \u003cconio.h\u003e#include \u003ccstdlib\u003e#include \"sqlite3/sqlite3.h\"#include \u003cstring\u003e \n using namespace std;  \n static int callback(void *NotUsed, int argc, char **argv, char **azColName){   \n  int i;   \n  for(i=0; i\u003cargc; i++){  printf(\"%s = %s\\n\", azColName[i], argv[i] ? argv[i] : \"NULL\");  }   \n  printf(\"\\n\");  return 0;}  \n int main(void){ sqlite3 *db;    char *zErrMsg = 0;    int rc;    string q = \"\";    string dbName = \"game.dat\";      \n  //Attempt to open database.

FyrePro serves customers throughout Colorado and Wyoming and these fireplaces will not only fit in with your existing décor but are also highly efficient. \n Looking for the ambiance that a wood fireplace brings to the home without the hassle? Consider one of our many gas fireplaces! Gas fireplaces offer the flames, warmth and character of a wood burning fireplace without the need for chopping wood or sweeping up ashes after each use. \n Gas fireplaces are lower maintenance than their wood fireplace counterparts. With gas fireplaces, there is no required chopping and storing of wood or cleaning out ash. Additionally, there is no need for a chimney which helps to further reduce costs and maintenance. Gas fireplaces are very environmentally friendly and can be run using your choice of either natural or propane gas, both of which are cleaning burning and do not release harmful chemicals into the air. \n High efficiency heating means less heat loss and reduced heating bills. By zone-heating high-traffic rooms with a gas fireplace, the exact temperature preferred in each room can be achieved which can help lower energy costs. Also, gas fireplaces work in case the electricity would go out, something very important during winter months when repairing electrical wires can take quite some time. \n Gas fireplaces offer a large number of special features over other types of fireplaces. You can easily turn on your fireplace with the flip of a switch or the touch of a button. You can also control the amount of heat output, the size of the flame and accent lights. Additionally, gas fireplaces come in a variety of aesthetic designs that can be customized to fit any style of home from traditional to modern. \n Not a lot of room? No problem! Zero-clearance gas fireplaces are able to fit into small rooms and take up very little room saving you space while also saving you money since these fireplaces are also highly efficient.

  "inline_text": "I have been terribly neglectful of my blog. Life has been a tad on the full on side and showing no signs of abating any time soon. Damn Sun in Scorpio :) Anyhoo, here are a few photos of what I've been up to. \n  \n         More news from the witch's stead soon! \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 09:41 AM  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (2)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n This week has been completely nuts. I've spent more time in waiting rooms this week than I care to think about (don't worry, everything is fine), and my house looks as though someone has broken into it and turned it upside down. Today I need to do some serious cleaning, before I even think about picking up a hook or the needles. \n Speaking of which, all the knitting I've done in uncomfortable chairs has assisted me in doing my shoulder in, so I will have to hook probably for today at least. Tomorrow I'm hoping to spend some quality time with the stole I'm making for Gabby at American Yarns. \n The time I have been at home this week, I've set up my new astrology web blog. You can check it out here . \n Also, I've just joined Plurk. I'm sure I need another social web site the same as I need another hole in my head but hey, it looks like fun. \n  \n I promise I will be more loquacious over the next few days. Thanks for bearing with me folks. :) \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 06:10 AM  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (0)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n    \n  \n These are both the Pretty Thing cowl pattern from the Yarn Harlot. Above it's worked in Red Hot Chocolate from Needlefood, and to the right, Camoflage from Lorna's Laces.  \n  \n  \n I'm a tad taken with cowls at the moment. I'm wondering if they would be better for the homeless than scarves. They are less chunky, but still very warm, and so small they would be easy to scrunch up and stash when not in use. Hmmm, will ponder that a bit more. \n  \n In other news, I'm going to be launching another blog soon, focusing on astrology. Stay tuned! \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 07:06 AM in knitting  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (0)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n This week I've cast on: \n The Pretty Thing pattern from the Yarn Harlot. We had our ups and downs initially resulting in two lots of frogging and starting over. I'm well into the pattern now, and enjoying it thoroughly. And it is certainly very, very pretty. It's not for me - no use for cowls in sub-tropical Queensland. I hope the recipient will be happy. I'm doing these on my new Addi circulars. They are great, but my one complaint would be that they aren't quite pointy enough. Unlike Knit Pros, which you could use as a weapon if you really wanted. \n Not quite casting on, as it's crochet, but I've started a blankie for my cousin's oldest son. I think I have the perfect teen boy colours, so I hope he likes it. His mother will love it because it won't show the dirt. \n I probably shouldn't mention the blanket I've started but not finished yet, or the two pairs of socks I still have on the needles. I probably should also not mention that I'm planning on casting on another pair of socks today - which will be a gift for the same lucky person who will be getting the cowl. \n  \n Have I mentioned that I would really love a clone? Or maybe the power of super speed. Hmm, the needles would probably catch on fire! \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 10:43 AM in crochet, knitting, Socks  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (0)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n I'm freshly home from the Brisbane Stitches and Craft show.  It was quite amusing as it was easy to spot the crafty people on the way there on the train. Mostly older women wearing eccentric handmade garb, or carrying handmade bags. I was astonished at the number of women trailing those bag-on-wheel things. I hope they managed to fill them up! \n  \n Funnier than that were the number of husbands sitting outside with a coffee and a newspaper, waiting for their wives to emerge. I do kinda feel sorry for crafting husbands, they seem to have limitless patience. \n  \n   \n The show itself was mainly geared towards quilters, scrapbookers and beaders. There were lots of very pretty sparkly things to look at. I ended up losing my mother and her friend (after they spent about half an hour in the first stall and I got tired of waiting for them) and wandered round by myself. It was a lovely morning. If you're a quilter, you'll need all day! \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 02:07 PM in Party!  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (3)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n Stephanie Pearl Macphee aka the Yarn Harlot, posed an interesting question in her blog the other day. How do non-knitters cope with stress? Or, is it that knitting attracts a certain type of person who needs maximum stress management? \n  \n As someone who suffers from an anxiety condition, knitting makes things tolerable for me. I can knit on public transport, which allows me to remove my focus from the crazies I'm on the train or bus with. It was particularly valuable on a day etched in my memory when an unwashed loonie got on the train, sat next to me and then said \"baaaa\" at regular intervals until we got to town (a good 20 minutes). My knitting helps me deal with being outside my comfort zone. Or, if I'm feeling particularly stressed out knitting helps bring me down so I can successfully interact with other people. It also helps me wind down at the end of the day. I can almost knit myself to sleep with that soothing repetitive motion. \n  \n  \n Would the world be a different place if kids were told to go do some knitting when they got cranky or stressed out?   \n  \n Knitters - how does the craft assist you in times of stress? \n  \n  \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 07:45 AM in Navel Gazing, Yarn Harlot  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (4)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n  \n    \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 02:45 PM in General Bitching, Navel Gazing  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (1)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n I'm not much of a sporting person, as I've mentioned in previous posts, but one of the sporting faces I've had respect for over the years is Frank Farina. Up until now. \n One of the things I've always found odd about Australians is the way we tend to treat our sporting heroes like rock stars. The various football leagues have had lots of trouble recently with their players misbehaving badly off field. These incidents are generally followed by the individual appearing dutifully remorseful for the cameras. For some reason, our sporting heroes are allowed to behave like unruly teenagers on their first night out on the town. Except teenagers have to stop drinking a lot earlier because they run out of money a lot more quickly than these men getting paid obscene amounts each year because they can kick a ball. \n  \n There is an anti drink driving campaign which runs on our television networks which states \"If you drink and drive, you're a bloody idiot.\" \n  \n Mr Farina is a bloody idiot. He was charged with drink driving for the second time in two years. This time, he was pulled over early in the morning (reports I've seen have reported times as being between 7 and 10 am) with a blood alcohol reading over twice the legal limit.There is no excuse for this behaviour for any member of the public, let alone a well renowned soccer coach.  Not only does Mr Farina deny that he has an alcohol issue, he is planning on suing the Brisbane Roar club due to their decision to terminate his contract because of his behaviour. Apparently, not driving while drunk was not a part of his contract. \n  \n Excuse me? \n  \n I am astonished at the suggestion that a sporting club should have to specify that a coach or player to not drink and drive. Should it also specify in a person's contract that they should not get drunk and beat up their partner? Surely if an action is considered an offence by the local laws, it should be taken as read that these behaviours won't be tolerated.  \n Sporting figures need to start taking responsibility for their actions and not expect that all will be forgiven because underneath, they are really top blokes. Grow up people, you are not that special. \n  \n I congradulate the Brisbane Roar club for taking such a stance and showing zero tolerance for such anti-social behaviour. \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 08:21 AM in Sports  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (1)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n I had such a full on day yesterday I completely forgot to blog! I hope the blogtober fairies won't smite me for this indiscretion! \n The reason I had such a huge day yesterday was that I had a job interview/try out kind of thing. Now it's a rare thing that you come away from an interview looking like this. \n  \n    \n The other night, I hit up the lovely Lesley from Chameleon Face Painting for a job. Yesterday I had a get together with her, and tried my hand at some face painting stuff, including completing someone's face (thanks again Lousie!) It was awesome fun, and Lesley has agreed to take me on and train me as a face painter.  \n I'm very excited. The idea of returning to a desk job was anathema to me. This is perfect. I'll be working with kids - and occasionally adults - and playing with pretty colours. Plus the witchlet is incredibly happy as I'll have to practice on her. She's been begging me for face paints for two years.  As soon as I'm a bit more skillful, I'll have a face painting party for her friends, so I will have a heap of little canvases to practice on.  \n On another note, it's one more sleep until Tina and Tim's wedding. Good luck kids! Hope you manage to get some sleep tonight!  \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 07:27 AM in face painting  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (1)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n  \n   \n  \n   \n I did finally finish Nellie's wavy blankie.

Just kidding Nell. \n  \n  \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  \n  \n I'm just over halfway with my mother's birthday socks. \n Working with these wonderful dark, rich colours has made me realise something ...

  "inline_text": "\n \n The Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor published the annual report on the situation with the respect of religious freedom in the FYR Macedonia in the course of 2006. \n There is an impression that the greater art of the report has been dedicated to the denial of religious freedom to the citizens, members of the Orthodox Ohrid Archbishopric.  \n http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71394.htm \n FYR. Macedonia has religious prisoners. \n The report deals with the imprisonment of His Beatitude, the Archbishop of Ohrid and Metropolitan of Skopje, k. k. Jovan implying that with the decision of the Supreme Court from February 2006, his prison sentence was reduced “which led to his release from prison, after which there were no cases of religious or political prisoners in the country”. We remind you that the Archbishop k. k. Jovan, after two releasing verdicts, has once again been put in prison, and the Macedonian Orthodox Church has once again filed a complaint against the liberating verdict reached regarding a third charge raised against him. The indicated proverbial corruption of the Macedonian judiciary is not subject to comment in this observation . \n   \n http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71394.htm \n According to the newest report of the Venice Commission, yet there are disputable items in the draft law of religious communities, especially at the point – registering religious communities. This report will be a subject of the following text. \n The Government of the FYR Macedonia, which protects the monopoly of the Macedonian Orthodox Church, is sacrificing the European future of the citizens. Critics point out the Government is only declaratively ready for reforms, while practically the reforms in terms of religious freedoms are tending to be evaded. \n At the same time, with the critics, in terms violating religious freedoms in the FYR Macedonia by the International Community, the Fund “Archbishop Jovan” from the United States of America has issued its newest \n  \n  'Criminally responsible'  \n  Mr Boskovski, 46, was alleged to have effective command and control over the forces from his position as interior minister.   \n         \n  \n  \"Due to his failure to take necessary and reasonable measures to punish the perpetrators of the crimes committed in the village of Ljuboten, the prosecution will ask you to find Ljube Boskovski criminally responsible as a superior,\" prosecutor Dan Saxon said.  \n  Prosecutors say Mr Tarculovski, 32, ran a private security unit loyal to Mr Boskovski and led the attack on the village. \n  \n There is support for Mr Boskovski in FYR MacedoniaSite against the imprisonment of Arch Bishop Jovan \n \n\n\n\n        ▼ \n      \n\n\n\n2010\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n        ▼ \n      \n\n\n\nMarch\n\n(1)\n\nViolations of Human Rights of Macedonian Citizens ...\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n        ▼ \n      \n\n\n\nMarch\n\n(1)\n\nViolations of Human Rights of Macedonian Citizens ...\n\n \n Violations of Human Rights of Macedonian Citizens ... \n \n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\n2008\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\nMarch\n\n(1)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\nMarch\n\n(1)\n \n \n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\n2007\n\n(7)\n\n\n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\nJuly\n\n(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\nJune\n\n(1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\nMay\n\n(2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\nFebruary\n\n(1)\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\nJuly\n\n(3)\n \n \n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\nJune\n\n(1)\n \n \n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\nMay\n\n(2)\n \n \n\n\n\n        ► \n      \n\n\n\nFebruary\n\n(1)\n",

  "inline_text": "\n \n The best way to use SQLite is to embed it in the game using the recommended amalgamation source code available on sqlite.org, but it is also available as a library for Windows (DLL) or Linux (shared-library .so ) . \n From a licensing point of view, using SQLite in any commercial game is also VERY safe since SQLite’s source has been released into the public domain. \n The following steps should allow C++ programmers to embed SQLite into their games. \n  \n Step 1 \n Go to http://www.sqlite.org and click on Download and grab  a file named sqlite-amalgamation-X_X_X.zip where the X’s are replaced by the appropriate version number. In my case I downloaded sqlite-amalgamation-3_7_0.zip (Windows) or sqlite-amalgamation-3.7.0.tar.gz (Linux) \n  \n  \n Step 2Extract the downloaded file and add the sqlite3.h and sqlite3.c files to the project. The size of the sqlite3.c file should be really big, around 3.96MB. \n Step 3Compile sqlite3.c in order to create a object file for it. The object file should be around 1.09MB. \n Step 4Include the sqlite3.h file in the game’s c++ files. For demonstration purposes I created a main.cpp file that looks as follows: \n #include \u003cstdio.h\u003e#include \u003ccstdlib\u003e#include \"sqlite3/sqlite3.h\"#include \u003cstring\u003eusing namespace std;int main(void){sqlite3 *db;char *zErrMsg = 0;int rc;string q = \"\";string dbName = \"game.dat\";//Attempt to open database. If it does not exist create it.rc = sqlite3_open(dbName.c_str(), \u0026db);if( rc ){fprintf(stderr, \"Can't open database: %s\\n\", sqlite3_errmsg(db));sqlite3_close(db);exit(1);}//Set query to executeq = \"\";sqlite3_close(db); //Always close db when done with itreturn 0;} \n Compile and run. There should now be a file called game.dat in the debug directory since SQLite will create the database file by default if it is not found. \n Step 5Since it is now possible to create a database it is time to create some tables. For demonstration purposes I created 2 tables. t_type and t_assets. \n  \n  \n  \n The Types table will simply contain information about various types of assets. The table will consist of an id for identification purposes, a parent id in order to be able to create a tree hierarchy and a title for what type it is, e.g. weapon, vehicle, npc, etc… \n The Assets table will contain information about a specific asset such as an image file or 3d object. The table consist of an id, a type id, src or location of the asset, title or name of the asset and a description.  E.g. Image of a “Toyota Bakkie” that is located at /assests/vehicles/toyota.png with the description:”A Red 4×4 Toyota Bakkie”. \n In order to execute queries on the database the sqlite3_exec function will be used. The code to do that follows: \n //Set query to executeq = \"CREATE TABLE t_type\"\"(\"\"'ID' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\"\"'PARENT_ID' INTEGER,\"\"'TITLE' TEXT\" \");\"\"CREATE TABLE t_assets\"\"(\"\"'ID' INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\"\"'TYPE_ID' INTEGER,\"\"'SRC' TEXT,\"\"'TITLE' TEXT,\"\"'DESCRIPTION' TEXT\"\");\";rc = sqlite3_exec(db, q.c_str(), NULL, 0, \u0026zErrMsg);if( rc!=SQLITE_OK ){fprintf(stderr, \"SQL error: %s\\n\", zErrMsg);sqlite3_free(zErrMsg);} \n  \n Note that I do not test whether a table actually exist, maybe you can add that to your code as a bit of an exercise? \n Step 6It is now time to insert some data. The query to do that follows: \n q = \"INSERT INTO t_type('PARENT_ID','TITLE') VALUES (0,'VEHICLES');\"\"INSERT INTO t_type('PARENT_ID','TITLE') VALUES (0,'ANIMALS');\"\"INSERT INTO t_assets('TYPE_ID','SRC','TITLE','DESCRIPTION') VALUES (1,'/assets/vechicles/toyota.png','A Red 4x4 Toyota Bakkie');\"\"INSERT INTO t_assets('TYPE_ID','SRC','TITLE','DESCRIPTION') VALUES (1,'/assets/vechicles/ferrari.png','A twin-turbo F50 Ferrari, like the one John Carmack drives');\"\"INSERT INTO t_assets('TYPE_ID','SRC','TITLE','DESCRIPTION') VALUES (2,'/assets/vechicles/munky.png','A munky. It is a bloody munky');\"; \n  \n You can of course do more advanced stuff like getting the ID of the types and then use that in the query. \n A Fast way to check the data in the file is to open it with notepad or notepad++ to check the results; but I will not recommend that approach with big files. \n Step 7In order to query the data, a callback function needs to be declared. The declaration for that looks as follows: \n static int callback(void*, int, char**, char**); \n  \n  \n This callback function will be called for each row returned from the query. \n The first parameter of this function is not really used.The second parameter contains the number of columns.The third parameter is an array containing the value of each column as a char*.The Fourth and last parameter contains the Names of each column. \n An example callback function follows: \n static int callback(void *NotUsed, int argc, char **argv, char **azColName){int i;for(i=0; i\u003cargc; i++){printf(\"%s = %s\\n\", azColName[i], argv[i] ? argv[i] : \"NULL\");}printf(\"\\n\");return 0;} \n  \n And this is how it will be used: \n q = \"SELECT * FROM t_assets WHERE TYPE_ID=1;\";rc = sqlite3_exec(db, q.c_str(), callback, 0, \u0026zErrMsg);if( rc!=SQLITE_OK ){fprintf(stderr, \"SQL error: %s\\n\", zErrMsg);sqlite3_free(zErrMsg);} \n Expected Output: \n  \n And that is it..The full source code for main.cpp looks as follows: \n  \n #include \u003cstdio.h\u003e#include \u003cconio.h\u003e#include \u003ccstdlib\u003e#include \"sqlite3/sqlite3.h\"#include \u003cstring\u003e \n using namespace std;  \n static int callback(void *NotUsed, int argc, char **argv, char **azColName){   \n  int i;   \n  for(i=0; i\u003cargc; i++){  printf(\"%s = %s\\n\", azColName[i], argv[i] ? argv[i] : \"NULL\");  }   \n  printf(\"\\n\");  return 0;}  \n int main(void){ sqlite3 *db;    char *zErrMsg = 0;    int rc;    string q = \"\";    string dbName = \"game.dat\";      \n  //Attempt to open database.

  "inline_text": " \n I started this blog in an attempt to start formalising a lot of my ideas and opinions, and develop a stronger focus in my life.  I have many wide-ranging interests, but am now learning that they may be all more closely connected than I ever imagined, and my goal now now is to see what I can turn them all into. \n I currently live on the Sunshine Coast of Australia, with my younger son, and my aging cat.  I am at university full-time, pursuing a  degree in nutrition and dietetics (with a side of exercise science).  I am also a qualified personal trainer. \n I love to cook, especially baking.  I am currently on a mission to eliminate most, if not all, processed foods from my kitchen, and only eat what I have made myself.  I already bake my own bread, but further goals for 2011, include making my own yoghurt and cheese.  However, I am not an extremist, by any means.  If the world did not include red wine and dark chocolate, then it would not be a happy place. \n I also love to sew, although at present, that has been pushed to the side as university has eliminated most of my free time.  I also grow some of my own food, although renting places limitations on that.  But I always have at least herbs and a few salad vegetables. \n My driving passion at present is the importance of food, and the part it plays in our lives (aside from the obvious, as fuel for energy).  I want to learn all I can- from how specific foods function and affect our bodies; to how it is produced and processed; the psychological/cultural relationship we have with food; and how it impacts on the rest of our life. \n looking forward to enjoying your posts!\nsingle mom too [;-)]\nhttp://lesleehare.wordpress.com/\nhttp://allaboutenlightenment.wordpress.com/ \n sorry to be so brief, but it’s 1:30 am here…  cheers! \n I enjoyed reading some of your posts.

Thank you for the good review of Talyn by Holly Lisle. I went to the bookstore and bought it on good faith and I’m in love with it right now. ;) \n [Ed: Here’s the link to the Talyn review.] \n I’m glad you’re liking it!  I got it though a Secret Santa program, and it blew me away that no one had ever pointed me to Holly Lisle’s stuff before. \n I’ve read most of Tamora Pierce’s Tortall books – through the Protector of the Small series.  I keep meaning to go back and read the Trickster series and pick up Beka Cooper… I’ll have to bump those up the list. \n Wow!  I’m impressed by the amount of reading you’ve done.  I may just have to keep track of the books I read from here on out. \n I am surprised you’ve read nothing by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes her “The Kiesha’ra” series is amazing considering she was in her teens when wrote it. The first book is ‘Hawksong’ The series is based on two peoples and the war and hatred between them. One group can become birds the other snakes, natural enemies. The heirs to the two repsective thrones decide that to end the war they must marry … really fantastic stuff. Add her to your pile! \n I’m curious about your selections and how you choose what gets into that To Be Read selection! For me, the new books I read are fairly heavily influenced by the reviews and author interviews and so on. I’m based Ireland. I have read some of the books on your list but the overlap is relatively small. I read mostly fiction with some biography and some business. \n Dear Fyrefly’s book blog. \n I am thoroughly entertained and astounded by the vast collection of books that you have read! I don’t think I’ve read that many books throughout my entire life! If I may recommend one more? I wish to you that you may get the chance to be able to read [Ed: Redacted to remove spammy bits] \n Your book list is soooooooo long @_@) \n Anyway, enjoy! \n Are you bored yet of hearing what an amazing idea this is? But it is.

For me, the new books I read are fairly heavily influenced by the reviews and author interviews and so on. I’m based Ireland. I have read some of the books on your list but the overlap is relatively small. I read mostly fiction with some biography and some business.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tReply\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \n \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tWalter Saide permalink\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSeptember 5, 2010 11:45 am\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Fyrefly’s book blog.\nI am thoroughly entertained and astounded by the vast collection of books that you have read!

While wood burning fireplaces require firewood \u0026 regular maintenance and gas burning fireplaces require a gas line \u0026 preventative cleaning, the only requirement with an electric fireplace is an electrical outlet. No other maintenance is needed! \n With the flip of a switch of the push of a button, you can instantly begin enjoying glowing, flickering flames and warmth. With new, advanced technology, you can enjoy picturesque 3-D flames and log sets that are so realistic, you can easily trick friends and family into thinking you have real flames and logs. Electric units have the added benefit of being operated with or without heat. This gives you the option to enjoy your fireplace year round from the chilly winter months to the sunny days of summer. \n Electric fireplaces come in a variety of types of units that can fit your home. Free-standing units are able to be moved from room to room giving you the option to have a fireplace in one room one day and another room the next. Wall units are available to be mounted which can provide a beautiful focal point to any room. \n If you have an existing wood or gas burning fireplace but are tired of the hassle associated with the maintenance of such a fireplace, electric inserts can be fitted to provide a maintenance free option. The electric insert gives you the appearance of a fireplace without the needed fuel and cleaning that comes with maintaining gas or wood burning units. \n Designed to save space, electric fireplaces can fit into even the smallest of rooms. With a wide variety of models to choose from, electric fireplaces are a great option if wood or gas fireplaces are not an option due to space constraints or safety issues.

(I love the term freestyled, it makes you sound all creative and free spirited, instead of the realisty of being too lazy to find and follow a pattern). \n It's crocheted, all trebles, using Moda Vera Paul yarn that I scored cheap from Spotlight last year.  \n It's a little big for her, but she'll grow into it. She thinks it's great. \n    \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n I've immediately cast on another pair of socks, as Mummy dearest's birthday is coming up. I've also got another pair on the needles, which I've christened my \"Can't be Arsed\" socks. I cast them on at about 11 the other night because the yarn was calling my name and I just wanted to see how it would knit up. They will probably just be house socks as the yarn is a bit too thick to wear with shoes, so I thought I may as well go all out in my laziness. I knit a row before joining, which is sinful, and frankly, a whole lot easier, and only did 5 rows of rib (which is my most hated part of the sock).  I'm wondering what other sock knitting blasphemies I can perform before this pair is over. \n  \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 08:22 AM in 52ppiii, crochet, knitting, Socks  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (2)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n I love September. Here in the great land of Aus, September is spring. The native plants are finishing their flowering season, there are baby birds everywhere. The days are clear and warm, and the nights are still cool enough to sleep comfortably. Perfect! September is also my birthday! \n This year, my friends got together and gave me a Spotlight voucher. My best friend now understands that there is no such thing as too much yarn, and is assisting me with my habit, bless her. Here are my birthday goodies: \n  \n  \n \n \n  I picked up a loom set and some balls of yarn, all of which will be used for socks. The blue and red balls I've been eyeing off for ages, but were a bit expensive. Perfect for buying with a gift voucher!  \n I also picked up a couple of circular needles to try to teach myself the Magic Loop method of sock knitting. At this point I'm not terribly impressed. It seems fiddly and irritating, and no where near as efficient as my DPNs.  Still I'm asking my Magic Loop loving friends on Ravelry to defend themselves explain their love of the circular needles. I'm wondering if the needles I've bought are substandard. The join is incredibly uneven and difficult to use. \n While I've been quiet, I've also been doing a heap of knitting. \n  Socks for the witchlet's stepmother were completed and seemed to be a hit.  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n My current project is a Ravlery based swap, so I won't post anything about that at this point, just in case my swappee manages to figure out I'm making stuff for her. Let's just say I'm working my little fingers to the bone. I did take a break over the last day or two and whip up these. \n \n \n  \n I don't think I've covered here the fact that I was asked not to come back to the witchlet's old school where I was still helping out (I guess that happens when you make a complaint about the principal) but it has been a bit of a blessing - it means the charity crafting I was doing for them has been dropped which gives me a heap more time for my projects till the end of the year. And then next year I can continue my charity focus with K4BN. Yay. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 08:11 AM in 52ppiii, K4BN, knitting, Socks, stash  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (0)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n The next pair of socks on my to-do list is a pair for my father for Father's day.

I've just been too slack to bother blogging about any of it. \n The Goddess Socks are done, and they feel as awesome as they look. \n   \n I wore them all day yesterday and didn't want to take them off last night. The yarn is gorgeous and soft and the pattern is so pretty! \n  \n Given my interest in socks, I've decided to join the 52 Pair Plunge on Ravelry. The goal is to make 52 pairs of socks in 52 weeks. I don't know if I'll make it, but I'll sure have fun trying! \n  \n I've also been inspired to start Guerrilla knitting, or yarn bombing. Basically the aim is to use yarn like graffiti to soften the landscape and to create art in public spaces. I have scoped out the local neighbourhood for places to \"tag\" and am knitting up appropriate shaped pieces to sew on in the dead of night. I will post pictures once the tagging has been done. \n I mentioned my new escapades to my mother and told her I was planning to have little tags on the items saying \"Knitted by Fyrewitch\". I may as well use fyrewitch as my street name as I use it everywhere else. My mother immediately wanted her own street name, so I christened her Dawgmutha on the spot. (Serves her right, she christened me Susan. Ick.) So if you see my mum wandering the streets, make sure you use the traditional greeting of \"Wassup Dawgmutha!\" At the very least, it will freak her out. \n  \n Guerrilla knitting has taken off in the states, and the founder of Knitta will be here in July, when there will be a display at the National Gallery in Canberra.

  "inline_text": " \n I started this blog in an attempt to start formalising a lot of my ideas and opinions, and develop a stronger focus in my life.  I have many wide-ranging interests, but am now learning that they may be all more closely connected than I ever imagined, and my goal now now is to see what I can turn them all into. \n I currently live on the Sunshine Coast of Australia, with my younger son, and my aging cat.  I am at university full-time, pursuing a  degree in nutrition and dietetics (with a side of exercise science).  I am also a qualified personal trainer. \n I love to cook, especially baking.  I am currently on a mission to eliminate most, if not all, processed foods from my kitchen, and only eat what I have made myself.  I already bake my own bread, but further goals for 2011, include making my own yoghurt and cheese.  However, I am not an extremist, by any means.  If the world did not include red wine and dark chocolate, then it would not be a happy place. \n I also love to sew, although at present, that has been pushed to the side as university has eliminated most of my free time.  I also grow some of my own food, although renting places limitations on that.  But I always have at least herbs and a few salad vegetables. \n My driving passion at present is the importance of food, and the part it plays in our lives (aside from the obvious, as fuel for energy).  I want to learn all I can- from how specific foods function and affect our bodies; to how it is produced and processed; the psychological/cultural relationship we have with food; and how it impacts on the rest of our life. \n looking forward to enjoying your posts!\nsingle mom too [;-)]\nhttp://lesleehare.wordpress.com/\nhttp://allaboutenlightenment.wordpress.com/ \n sorry to be so brief, but it’s 1:30 am here…  cheers! \n I enjoyed reading some of your posts.

  "inline_text": "Yarnwork is one of my great passions. One of my other great passions is astrology. \n I confess I used to think that astrology was a big pile of crap. How is it possible for everyone assigned a Virgo to have the same thing happen to them on a given day? Impossible! Exactly. I've since learnt that the horoscopes in your average newspaper/magazine is like going to a tabloid and expecting decent reporting.  \n Astrology is thousands of years old and really is an amazing science. It could take you a lifetime of studying to actually learn every bit of it (which, frankly, is one of the reasons why it appeals to me). \n Beginning about a year ago, Pluto, the Lord of the Underworld, made it's first ingress into Capricorn, the sign of the earth and of big business. It was about that time that the first stockmarket dip occurred. Pluto is now at about 2 degrees of Capricorn and making himself right at home - as you may have noticed with economies going belly up the world over. Pluto will also, however, have an immediate effect on people if they are having a transit (ie, the planet is passing over something in your natal chart). It astounded me around Christmas time, the number of young people in the news who had died in accidents either on or close to their birthdays - when Pluto would have been sitting on their natal Suns. \n At the moment I'm beginning a significant Pluto transit. Pluto transits take a good two years to work through as the planet is so far away and moves so slowly. So far so good, I've been doing a lot of work and preparation towards this to try to help things along. But just over the last 5 days or so, I've been feeling very much surrounded by Plutonian events. \n On Friday, there was a massive housefire in which someone was killed, a street away from where my daughter is in daycare. She doesn't go to a centre but in someone's home, and I turned into the street to find it closed off with police cars and fire engines everywhere. Now the house is fenced off and surrounded by police tape. I know this stuff happens all the time, but I've never experienced it so close to home before.  \n The witchlet's step-grandfather had a heart attack on the weekend. He is recovering now and should be fine. \n A friend of mine has been diagnosed with cancer. She has travelled this path before, and didn't particularly want to go down it again. \n And lastly, an airline which owes a significant amount of money to the company I work for has just gone down the tubes. Watching the slow disintigration of the company I work for is like playing kerplunk - the sticks are coming out slowly but surely, and it's just a matter of time before the marbles come crashing down. \n I'm not particularly stressed by any of these events, just watching with a vague curiousity and praying for those who need praying for and trying to support those who need it. And wondering ... what will be next? The world (and the universe for that matter) is certainly an amazing place.\n  \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 10:55 AM in astrology  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (1)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n Check out my new\n\nAstrology Blog!\nAugust - 20 \n July - 30\n \n April - 50 \n March - 9 \n February - 8 \n January - 5 \n Total for 2008 - 29 \n 52ppiii (4) \n astrology (1) \n Blog This (3) \n blue hexie blanket (1) \n Books (4) \n crochet (5) \n Current Affairs (5) \n face painting (1) \n first day of school (2) \n Flat Feet (1) \n General Bitching (6) \n General house stuff (2) \n K4BN (4) \n knitting (11) \n knitting kids (1) \n Navel Gazing (10) \n Observations (3) \n Party!

  "inline_text": "If you could choose a day, a week, a moment in time to re-live - what would it be?    \n \nWould you change anything?  Take us back there - with words and pictures if you can.... \n  \n This is such a great challenge. Like most people, I've had a number of less than impressive moments in my life that I can look back on with shame and embarrassment. I wish I could make them disappear. But isn't that the point of life? Making wrong decisions, having them backfire on you and learning from the experience.  That feeling of shame and embarrassment that stays with you makes sure that you will never make that same mistake again. If you could make a wish and actually make it disappear, then you would no doubt end up making the same mistake again. \n  \n  The time in my life I would like to go back to is one that gave me immeasurable joy. Earlier this year, the witchlet and I had a week's holiday at Kirra on the Gold Coast. I love Kirra the way it is at the moment. It's perfect for families. Kids can run and run as there is just so much beach and so few people on it.  \n We stayed in a lovely hotel called Kirra on the Beach, which was right across the road from the sand. We took most of our meals at a lovely cafe adjacent, which had just been taken over by a family from Paris. It was wonderful to talk to them, listen to their French accents and hear about Paris. Plus, the food was amazing! \n It was such a wonderful week, just the kid and me, removed from all the worries of the world. There was precious little housework to do, no school or work to worry about. Just the beach, and the sun. \n  \n  We took a day trip to the Crystal Castle, where the witchlet was awed by the amazing geodes.  \n We took another day trip to the famous O'Reilly's bird sanctuary and stopped in at an Alpaca farm along the way.  They had a number of babies which were only days old. They were so cute! We tried to figure out how to get one back on the bus with us, but the fence was a bit too high for us to carry out the deed. \n The witchlet adored the alpacas, but had much more fun feeding the birds at O'Reilly's.  \n  \n The week was such a wonderful opportunity for us both, but particularly for me. It was the first time I'd really managed to draw breath and take time out to really be with my girl since her father and I divorced when she was tiny. I had spent so much time trying to make sure that we had a roof over our heads and that she had the absolute best that I could give her that I had forgotten the reason that I was working so hard in the first place. I discovered how much of her I had already missed. Another mistake I wish I could reverse.  \n Not long after this trip, I quit my job. My witchlet is my life. Things are tougher financially, but our relationship has never been stronger.   \n I will always remember her joy and wonder that week at the beach. And I wouldn't change a thing. \n  \n   \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 08:02 AM in Blog This, Navel Gazing  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (1)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n This is actually a very appropriate challenge as my birthday is coming up in a couple of weeks! \n I think I'm the easiest person on the planet to find gifts for, as there is one major category of \"stuff\" that will make me happy every time. \n  \n Yarn. \n  \n  According to some people, it can get too hot to knit. I can't say I've noticed. I love knitting and crocheting. I have a piece on my lap as I type this. Yarn craft keeps me sane.  I take it with me where ever I go - you never know when you might get some down time. \n  \n Socks are my big thing at the moment. They  are small and are very portable, fitting easily into a handbag. The basic sock pattern is easy to memorise once you've done it a couple of times, so you don't need to cart that with you either.  \n  \n Most of my knitting is for other people. I belong to two charities - Knitting for Brisbane's Needy and Knit 4 Charity - and knit items for them in order to help people less fortunate than myself. A lot of my crafting this year has gone to Strathpine West State School for their upcoming fete. There's only so much knitting you can do for yourself in the Brisbane climate. Knitting items for people who you know will appreciate them is so much better than churning stuff out for relatives who look at you sideways when you present them with a gift. You can almost here them thinking \"Bloody hell, not more knitting.\" \n  \n The other thing I love about yarn is that it has a purpose. Each ball or skein is full of potential. It could be a scarf, cap, jumper, tank top, blanket. It might keep someone's feet warm, or be wrapped around a street sign for decoration. When you give someone yarn, you give them a hundred grams of opportunity for them to seize and fulfill. I ask you, what could possibly be a better gift? \n  \n   \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 09:48 AM in Blog This, knitting  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (3)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n I've recently started following the Blog This site, which is a site specifically targeting Aussie Bloggers. One of the recent challenges that I missed was the above title, and I love books so much that I feel the need to pass comment. \n I love books. Prior to my divorce I had about 1000 of them. Moving to a much smaller house meant I had to cull my collection by about two thirds. 5 years later and I still miss them. A friend of mine laughingly says that whenever I gain a new interest, my book collection increases. \n When I was at uni, my favourite place to hang out was the library. Any library. During my studies at QUT I would do weekend \"library crawls\" where I would start at Kelvin Grove campus, walk to Gardens Point, then jump back on the train and hit the Carseldine library. The undergrad library at the University of Queensland was my favourite though. The books smelled awesome and there were just so many, on every topic you could possibly imagine. I would stand in awe and gaze at the books, wandering up and down the aisles, gently touching the old covers, thinking about all the stuff I hadn't yet learned.  \n During the holiday periods, while everyone else was drinking and partying, I would load up on as many books as I was allowed to take home and spend the time reading. My favourite holiday period was one where I took all the fiction from the existentialists that I could find - Simone de Beauvoir (one of my heroes), Jean-Paul Satre, Albert Camus - and buried myself in their world. From de Beauvoir's depressive immortal man in All Men are Mortal to their tales about the resistance during the second World War, I found their words and worlds fascinating. \n I don't actually have a bedside table. I tried that, but it just wasn't big enough. I actually have a bedside bookcase, and it's full to overflowing.  It contains books about all the things I love - knitting, astrology, tarot, Wicca, Buddhism. I think there's even some fiction in there - Neil Gaiman, Robert Rankin and Terry Pratchett. Since my daughter has come along, I find it difficult to get any decent reading done. I tend to pick up a book and read a chapter or so on whatever I'm thinking about at the time prior to bed. Pema Chodron inspires me, Erin Sullivan helps me to nut out planetary relationships, Rachel Pollack and Dione Fortune assist me on my seemingly never-ending quest to learn about the Qabbalah, and Robert Rankin makes me laugh. \n Books are like old friends. I find that picking them up and delving into them can take me back to the time that I bought it, or back to the state of mind and feelings that I had when I first read it. Whenever I read Bram Stoker's Dracula, I am transported back to my first reading of the book at the age of 18 - sitting in my bedroom at my parents in a rocking chair, knees up to my chin, with Mozart's Requim Mass blaring and adding to the ambiance and totally freaking me out. It was wonderful! \n I am trying to pass on my love of reading to my daughter. At the age of 7 she is very keen to read by herself and is finally asking me to read to her. I've packed most of my books away to make room for hers. At the moment it's lots of Doctor Seuss and Disney stuff, but I look forward to seeing where her tastes end up. \n  \n  \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 07:57 AM in Blog This, Books  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (1)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n Check out my new\n\nAstrology Blog!\nAugust - 20 \n July - 30\n \n April - 50 \n March - 9 \n February - 8 \n January - 5 \n Total for 2008 - 29 \n 52ppiii (4) \n astrology (1) \n Blog This (3) \n blue hexie blanket (1) \n Books (4) \n crochet (5) \n Current Affairs (5) \n face painting (1) \n first day of school (2) \n Flat Feet (1) \n General Bitching (6) \n General house stuff (2) \n K4BN (4) \n knitting (11) \n knitting kids (1) \n Navel Gazing (10) \n Observations (3) \n Party!

  "inline_text": "Yesterday, if you listened closely, you could hear a collective sigh all over the state of Queensland. Yes, that's right, it was the first day of school. Parents the state over delivered their little darlings to the hallowed halls of their local learning institution, dropped them off with a hug and a kiss, and then made their way in all due haste to the local coffee shop and thanked the powers that be that the holidays were finally over, as little precious may not have survived another week at home. \n I took a raincheck on the coffee shop routine and instead came home and listened to the quiet for a little, and then sat down with the juicy blue blanket and watched an M rated DVD for the first time in 6 weeks. \n I've now reached the 120 hexagon mark, which means I may actually finish the blankie for Tim's birthday party on February 7. Mind you, it will probably take a full day to finish off all the ends - my least favourite job, and I've managed to ignore it totally so far. \n \n It's coming along quite nicely don't you think? \n I also received a package yesterday containing: \n \n I used to write all the time when I was younger, but I haven't done much in the last few years, and I'm wanting to get back into it.

And I may have to go buy myself a fancy journal and (gasp) a fountain pen today! \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 07:56 AM in blue hexie blanket, first day of school  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (1)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n Check out my new\n\nAstrology Blog!\nAugust - 20 \n July - 30\n \n April - 50 \n March - 9 \n February - 8 \n January - 5 \n Total for 2008 - 29 \n 52ppiii (4) \n astrology (1) \n Blog This (3) \n blue hexie blanket (1) \n Books (4) \n crochet (5) \n Current Affairs (5) \n face painting (1) \n first day of school (2) \n Flat Feet (1) \n General Bitching (6) \n General house stuff (2) \n K4BN (4) \n knitting (11) \n knitting kids (1) \n Navel Gazing (10) \n Observations (3) \n Party!

  "inline_text": "October seems to be the month that people adopt as their own. I don't know what it is about October that makes this happen. Is it because is starts with a vowel and has more than two syllables (Blogust just sounds wrong). Is it the Virgo energy morphing into Libran energy, the desire to serve morphing into the energy of of getting out there and relating to others (which then ends in the Scorpio need to go underground). Or is it just that it's taken us all 9 months to get organised, and the close proximity of December makes us realise that we've actually achieved very little this year, and we should probably get a wriggle on and do something constructive. \n  \n Dare I try to blog every day? The minutea of my life aren't actually that interesting, so I will probably turn to lots of philosophising and pontificating. Dear Reader, if you aren't up for that sort of crap, I suggest you check back in November, when the madness has ended. \n  \n I received my latest Amazon order yesterday. Bless Amazon, you have to love a service that allows you to buy books and have them shipped for a fraction of the cost that it is to purchase them off the shelf in this country. \n  \n I received my copies of The Knitting Way and Mindful Knitting, both focusing on Knitting as a spiritual practise. How perfect!  I've started on the first, which has thus far spoken lots about mathematics and the beauty of maths in nature. I hate maths and recoil from it, so fortunately there are some nice patterns in there as well. Although the patterns are all in Americanese, so I'll have to go find out what a size 8 needle actually is, and convert all the inches etc before they make any sense to me. Why do I knit again?? \n  \n Hmm, I have the sudden urge to declutter. \n  \n  \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 07:47 AM in Books, General Bitching, Navel Gazing  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (1)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n I've recently started following the Blog This site, which is a site specifically targeting Aussie Bloggers. One of the recent challenges that I missed was the above title, and I love books so much that I feel the need to pass comment. \n I love books. Prior to my divorce I had about 1000 of them. Moving to a much smaller house meant I had to cull my collection by about two thirds. 5 years later and I still miss them. A friend of mine laughingly says that whenever I gain a new interest, my book collection increases. \n When I was at uni, my favourite place to hang out was the library. Any library. During my studies at QUT I would do weekend \"library crawls\" where I would start at Kelvin Grove campus, walk to Gardens Point, then jump back on the train and hit the Carseldine library. The undergrad library at the University of Queensland was my favourite though. The books smelled awesome and there were just so many, on every topic you could possibly imagine. I would stand in awe and gaze at the books, wandering up and down the aisles, gently touching the old covers, thinking about all the stuff I hadn't yet learned.  \n During the holiday periods, while everyone else was drinking and partying, I would load up on as many books as I was allowed to take home and spend the time reading. My favourite holiday period was one where I took all the fiction from the existentialists that I could find - Simone de Beauvoir (one of my heroes), Jean-Paul Satre, Albert Camus - and buried myself in their world. From de Beauvoir's depressive immortal man in All Men are Mortal to their tales about the resistance during the second World War, I found their words and worlds fascinating. \n I don't actually have a bedside table. I tried that, but it just wasn't big enough. I actually have a bedside bookcase, and it's full to overflowing.  It contains books about all the things I love - knitting, astrology, tarot, Wicca, Buddhism. I think there's even some fiction in there - Neil Gaiman, Robert Rankin and Terry Pratchett. Since my daughter has come along, I find it difficult to get any decent reading done. I tend to pick up a book and read a chapter or so on whatever I'm thinking about at the time prior to bed. Pema Chodron inspires me, Erin Sullivan helps me to nut out planetary relationships, Rachel Pollack and Dione Fortune assist me on my seemingly never-ending quest to learn about the Qabbalah, and Robert Rankin makes me laugh. \n Books are like old friends. I find that picking them up and delving into them can take me back to the time that I bought it, or back to the state of mind and feelings that I had when I first read it. Whenever I read Bram Stoker's Dracula, I am transported back to my first reading of the book at the age of 18 - sitting in my bedroom at my parents in a rocking chair, knees up to my chin, with Mozart's Requim Mass blaring and adding to the ambiance and totally freaking me out. It was wonderful! \n I am trying to pass on my love of reading to my daughter. At the age of 7 she is very keen to read by herself and is finally asking me to read to her. I've packed most of my books away to make room for hers. At the moment it's lots of Doctor Seuss and Disney stuff, but I look forward to seeing where her tastes end up. \n  \n  \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 07:57 AM in Blog This, Books  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (1)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n  I haven't finished the Twilight series yet, but whilst waiting for an appointment, I dropped into my local book store and The Host caught my eye. The description on the back caught my imagination and I snapped it up.  \n Earth has been taken over by a group of aliens who call themselves Souls. They insert themselves into their host bodies and then continue living on in the lifestyle of the planet. \n The Souls have never experienced a species that fought back. Wanderer is inserted into Melanie, one of the last of the resistance. But Melanie won't just fade away as her other hosts have. Wanderer submits to the pressure placed on her by her host mind and goes to find the man she loves ... with interesting and unexpected results. \n As a person who is interested in what happens inside people's heads, this book was fascinating - what would happen if you had two people in there wanting disparate things? \n Meyer creates a fascinating internal world as Wanderer learns more about the species her people have taken over and starts to wonder at her own right to live the way she does. \n I really enjoyed this book, much more than the Twilight books. Towards the end I literally couldn't put it down. Meyer poses and deals with some really interesting moral and ethical dilemmas in a very unique way. Read it, it rocks! \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 08:11 AM in Books  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (0)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n \n I've just finished The Reader. I would give it a four out of five, although in saying that I enjoyed it in the same way I would a philosophy text rather than as a work of fiction. The fiction I like normally has more adjectives in it. What is it about the Germans and their dislike of description? That aside, it is very thought provoking, which in my view marks it as a successful piece of literature. I'm going to issue a spoiler alert as well, as I'm going to talk about things you may not wish to know if you're going to read the book yourself. \n Michael Berg, at the age of 15, has a relationship with the 36 year old Hannah. She asks about his school work, which leads to a tradition of him reading to her, until one day, she mysteriously disappears.  \n The next time Michael sees Hannah it is as a defendant in a war crimes trial. She is accused of having been a prison guard during the war who allowed a large group of women and girls to burn to death in a church.  \n The book asks questions about how tolerant post World War 2 Gemans were of the Nazis, and whether or not all Germans who knew what was going on in the concentrations camps but turned their backs were not as guilty as those perpetrating the crimes. When it is revealed that Hannah was a guard at Auschwitz, Michael wonders why she isn't being tried for the crimes that occurred there. \n The women who were killed were on a death march through the country side. They stopped this particular night in a small town. The women and girls were locked in the church while the guards took beds elsewhere. Bombs were dropped, setting the church, and other buildings on fire, and the doors were not opened to let the prisoners out.  The other female guards pin the blame for this directly on Hannah, whose reasoning seemed to be that it was more humane to let them burn to death than to continue marching them through the country and allowing them to die slowly.  \n Hannah is decreed by the judge as being more guilty than the other guards she was with, yet you also are left to wonder at just how guilty the judge himself is - one of the points made by the book is that many Nazis rose to high levels in the legal system. Most of the guilt is applied to her due to a false report which was lodged about the incident. There are sufficient clues in the text indicating that Hannah is illiterate, yet she testifies that she wrote this report. \n Hannah is sentenced to a long term of imprisonment, and whilst she is incarcerated, Michael records himself reading and sends her the tapes. He also questions his own guilt due to his feelings for Hannah. \n During her time in prison, Hannah learns how to read, and then asks for books about the concentration camps. It seems as though this gives her a better understanding of the horrors she was involved in. \n How guilty is guilty when it comes to these complex situations? Is it enough to silently stand by and shake your head? Or to declare you don't know what's going on and enquire no further? And, more importantly, where can we apply these questions to our society right now? \n \n\t\t\t\t\n                Posted at 02:47 PM in Books  | Permalink\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\tComments (1)\n                                    \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\t\t\t\t\tTrackBack (0)\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n Check out my new\n\nAstrology Blog!\nAugust - 20 \n July - 30\n \n April - 50 \n March - 9 \n February - 8 \n January - 5 \n Total for 2008 - 29 \n 52ppiii (4) \n astrology (1) \n Blog This (3) \n blue hexie blanket (1) \n Books (4) \n crochet (5) \n Current Affairs (5) \n face painting (1) \n first day of school (2) \n Flat Feet (1) \n General Bitching (6) \n General house stuff (2) \n K4BN (4) \n knitting (11) \n knitting kids (1) \n Navel Gazing (10) \n Observations (3) \n Party!

  "link": "https://fyrelife.wordpress.com/2011/06/30/fun-and-sex/",
  "inline_text": "Strangely enough, the two words are not meant to be interchangeable.  True, sometimes sex can be fun…and sometimes it can be bloody horrible too.  But my real point is, that the word fun should not be directly correlated to sex. \n Now, any woman that has ventured into the world of online dating has encountered those men (they appear to be legion) who mean nothing but sex, when they type the word fun on their keyboard (there may be women who think the same way – thankfully I personally have been spared their acquaintance thus far). \n It is not always easy to pick out those who subscribe to this narrow definition.  Sometimes, they put it in their profiles, or in an initial email, which gives the recipient the painless option of immediately blocking the profile, and/or deleting the email.  Quite simple really. \n But then there are those who write quite innocuous profiles (sometimes quite interesting ones), and who write pleasant and polite initial emails.  You respond, exchange a few more emails, begin to think “hey, this sounds like an interesting person”. and you move into IM exchanges. \n Now many websites have their own IMs, which make it easy to eliminate someone who transgresses (without having to block them from your personal online communication tool of choice.  Most sites do not have web-cam options though.  So the first clue, is when a man (or woman) becomes very urgent in their desire to talk to you on Messenger, Yahoo, Skype, etc.   A red flag that, curiously enough, they share with scammers. \n Once they exchange ids with you, and open up a chat window in this new platform, the next question is “Can you turn on your web-cam?”.    If you – wisely – demur to comply, the chances are, after some token protest, that they will accept your choice, but still insist on opening up their web-cam. \n Now, some of them will initially appear clothed.  Or at least, the portion of them that you can see is clothed.  If they are bare-chested, unless they appear to be sitting on a beach, where the passerbys are all wearing beach-style clothing, it is best to assume the nudity is total. \n It doesn’t take them long to get down to business (strange how I always considered business and fun to be at different ends of the spectrum!), and they will either invite you to view them (au naturale), ask you if you want to play a little, or if you want to watch them play a little.  If you again demur, they will then trot out the magic phrase “Aw, it’s just having a bit of fun!”. \n Seriously?  Watching some guy you barely/don’t  know jerk off, is fun?  Since when? \n Some of them don’t even ask first, but instead suddenly redirect the direction of their webcam in the direction of their genitalia, where they are already “playing”.  Presumably, they think that under those circumstances, you will be so enthralled by the sight of their appendage, that you will become glued to the screen, and pant along with them.   \n EEEWWWW!!! \n To the men that engage in this behaviour, or even try to entice women to play along, I have to say…this is NOT fun.  What this is, is crass, crude, vulgar and quite often disgusting and totally abhorent.   While an existing couple, in a loving relationship may choose to use internet sex as a way to maintain their relationship if temporarily separated, when it is a virtual stranger, then it is no better than having a man come up to you in the street, and expose himself to you.   \n Yes, guys, you are that dirty old man, in a dirty raincoat, flashing himself to strangers, in order to satisfy a perverse craving.  There is nothing “fun” about what you are doing, at all.  Women are not thrilled or turned on, seeing your naked penis.  You think we’ve never seen one before?  You think we might actually be impressed?  We might laugh at you and your rabid self-delusion – which is about as much fun as we will get from this situation – but we are never, ever impressed. \n I want the men/boys/perverts who consider this behaviour “fun” to find a dictionary, and check on the definition of the word.  I then want them to think back to their childhood, to that point where someone must have explained to them, that when you do something that hurts/upsets/disgusts/repels another person, no matter how much enjoyment you may personally gain from engaging in these actions, what you are doing is not fun, and is not acceptable behaviour.  Guys, is that what really turns you on?  Disgusting and revolting another human being?  If so, then you need serious therapy. \n I want the word fun given back to people who actually know how to have fun.  I don’t want to have to cringe, every time I talk to a man online, and he asks me if I want to have fun – I want to genuinely believe he is talking about inviting me out on a fun date, or something equally innocuous.  I don’t want to dread being asked if I have a webcam…I want to know that when someone asks to talk on webcam it’s because they want to genuinely see me as a person (and possibly to check I’m not posting fake photos).  When a man asks me if I want to watch him play online, I want him to mean he is playing a musical instrument. \n Because, to me, none of these things are fun, or playing, or having a good time.  What they are, is a man who is virtually a stranger to me, engaging in seriously deviant behaviour, that would get him arrested if he did it in person.  Being separated by the internet does not give someone licence to be a sex offender. \n   \n Fill in your details below

sometimes it can be bloody horrible too.  But my real point is, that the word fun should not be directly correlated to sex.\nNow, any woman that has ventured into the world of online dating has encountered those men (they appear to be legion) who mean nothing but sex, when they type the word fun on their keyboard (there may be women who think the same way – thankfully I personally have been spared their acquaintance thus far).\nIt is not always easy to pick out those who subscribe to this narrow definition.  Sometimes, they put it in their profiles, or in an initial email, which gives the recipient the painless option of immediately blocking the profile, and/or deleting the email.  Quite simple really.\nBut then there are those who write quite innocuous profiles (sometimes quite interesting ones), and who write pleasant and polite initial emails.  You respond, exchange a few more emails, begin to think “hey, this sounds like an interesting person”. and you move into IM exchanges.\nNow many websites have their own IMs, which make it easy to eliminate someone who transgresses (without having to block them from your personal online communication tool of choice.  Most sites do not have web-cam options though.  So the first clue, is when a man (or woman) becomes very urgent in their desire to talk to you on Messenger, Yahoo, Skype, etc.   A red flag that, curiously enough, they share with scammers.\nOnce they exchange ids with you, and open up a chat window in this new platform, the next question is “Can you turn on your web-cam?”.    If you – wisely – demur to comply, the chances are, after some token protest, that they will accept your choice, but still insist on opening up their web-cam.\nNow, some of them will initially appear clothed.  Or at least, the portion of them that you can see is clothed.  If they are bare-chested, unless they appear to be sitting on a beach, where the passerbys are all wearing beach-style clothing, it is best to assume the nudity is total.\nIt doesn’t take them long to get down to business (strange how I always considered business and fun to be at different ends of the spectrum!), and they will either invite you to view them (au naturale), ask you if you want to play a little, or if you want to watch them play a little.  If you again demur, they will then trot out the magic phrase “Aw, it’s just having a bit of

  "inline_text": "Strangely enough, the two words are not meant to be interchangeable.  True, sometimes sex can be fun…and sometimes it can be bloody horrible too.  But my real point is, that the word fun should not be directly correlated to sex. \n Now, any woman that has ventured into the world of online dating has encountered those men (they appear to be legion) who mean nothing but sex, when they type the word fun on their keyboard (there may be women who think the same way – thankfully I personally have been spared their acquaintance thus far). \n It is not always easy to pick out those who subscribe to this narrow definition.  Sometimes, they put it in their profiles, or in an initial email, which gives the recipient the painless option of immediately blocking the profile, and/or deleting the email.  Quite simple really. \n But then there are those who write quite innocuous profiles (sometimes quite interesting ones), and who write pleasant and polite initial emails.  You respond, exchange a few more emails, begin to think “hey, this sounds like an interesting person”. and you move into IM exchanges. \n Now many websites have their own IMs, which make it easy to eliminate someone who transgresses (without having to block them from your personal online communication tool of choice.  Most sites do not have web-cam options though.  So the first clue, is when a man (or woman) becomes very urgent in their desire to talk to you on Messenger, Yahoo, Skype, etc.   A red flag that, curiously enough, they share with scammers. \n Once they exchange ids with you, and open up a chat window in this new platform, the next question is “Can you turn on your web-cam?”.    If you – wisely – demur to comply, the chances are, after some token protest, that they will accept your choice, but still insist on opening up their web-cam. \n Now, some of them will initially appear clothed.  Or at least, the portion of them that you can see is clothed.  If they are bare-chested, unless they appear to be sitting on a beach, where the passerbys are all wearing beach-style clothing, it is best to assume the nudity is total. \n It doesn’t take them long to get down to business (strange how I always considered business and fun to be at different ends of the spectrum!), and they will either invite you to view them (au naturale), ask you if you want to play a little, or if you want to watch them play a little.  If you again demur, they will then trot out the magic phrase “Aw, it’s just having a bit of fun!”. \n Seriously?  Watching some guy you barely/don’t  know jerk off, is fun?  Since when? \n Some of them don’t even ask first, but instead suddenly redirect the direction of their webcam in the direction of their genitalia, where they are already “playing”.  Presumably, they think that under those circumstances, you will be so enthralled by the sight of their appendage, that you will become glued to the screen, and pant along with them.   \n EEEWWWW!!! \n To the men that engage in this behaviour, or even try to entice women to play along, I have to say…this is NOT fun.  What this is, is crass, crude, vulgar and quite often disgusting and totally abhorent.   While an existing couple, in a loving relationship may choose to use internet sex as a way to maintain their relationship if temporarily separated, when it is a virtual stranger, then it is no better than having a man come up to you in the street, and expose himself to you.   \n Yes, guys, you are that dirty old man, in a dirty raincoat, flashing himself to strangers, in order to satisfy a perverse craving.  There is nothing “fun” about what you are doing, at all.  Women are not thrilled or turned on, seeing your naked penis.  You think we’ve never seen one before?  You think we might actually be impressed?  We might laugh at you and your rabid self-delusion – which is about as much fun as we will get from this situation – but we are never, ever impressed. \n I want the men/boys/perverts who consider this behaviour “fun” to find a dictionary, and check on the definition of the word.  I then want them to think back to their childhood, to that point where someone must have explained to them, that when you do something that hurts/upsets/disgusts/repels another person, no matter how much enjoyment you may personally gain from engaging in these actions, what you are doing is not fun, and is not acceptable behaviour.  Guys, is that what really turns you on?  Disgusting and revolting another human being?  If so, then you need serious therapy. \n I want the word fun given back to people who actually know how to have fun.  I don’t want to have to cringe, every time I talk to a man online, and he asks me if I want to have fun – I want to genuinely believe he is talking about inviting me out on a fun date, or something equally innocuous.  I don’t want to dread being asked if I have a webcam…I want to know that when someone asks to talk on webcam it’s because they want to genuinely see me as a person (and possibly to check I’m not posting fake photos).  When a man asks me if I want to watch him play online, I want him to mean he is playing a musical instrument. \n Because, to me, none of these things are fun, or playing, or having a good time.  What they are, is a man who is virtually a stranger to me, engaging in seriously deviant behaviour, that would get him arrested if he did it in person.  Being separated by the internet does not give someone licence to be a sex offender. \n   \n We’ve all heard of friends with benefits.  There has even been a movie recently made on the topic, which, being a romantic comedy, romanticises the notion, and of course, implies that such a course is not doomed to disaster. \n The tv series, Boston Legal, also visited the subject with two of their longer-running characters.  Of course, the fact that the woman in question was a very assertive, strong woman, who controlled the connection (at one point, she had two such “friends” at the same time) and that the main friend was in love with her made the whole scenario rather untrue to life. \n I know people who have walked that path.  In most cases it has led to disaster.  Way too many women think that if they go along with it, eventually the man in question will be smitten by their charms and will lay his heart at their feet.  In a couple of cases, it has worked out ok, but only when both people seriously do not want any more than a purely sexual arrangement, and both have eventually gone their separate ways quite happily.  But I personally, don’t know anyone that started off with that arrangement, and ended up together happily ever after.  No doubt it has happened, somewhere, to someone…but I would be very surprised if anyone could prove it to be a statistical probability. \n So, what is friends with benefits?  It is theoretically, an arrangement where two single people agree to meet sexual needs with each other, without all the hassle of a commitment of any kind (including something as harmless as boyfriend/girlfriend).  In essence, there are no promises, no guarantees, and either party is free to walk at any time guilt-free.  It sounds very mature, practical and modern, doesn’t it? \n Personally, since it is called friends with benefits, my literal assumption would be that the two people concerned were aquaintances, with common bonds and ties of friendship, and some background of liking and respect for one another.  Under those circumstances, and with suitable levels of sexual attraction for one another, and a background of social interaction which might or might not lead to sex on any given occasion, I could almost see this as being an eminently practical solution for many singles. \n There is a problem though. \n Many, many people who announce they want friends with benefits publicly – i.e. dating sites – are men…mostly very young men.  But for those who actually spell it out, they are not looking for any kind of friendship, or bond or social interaction with the opposite gender.  They just want to have sex without any kind of connection at all.  Most of them don’t even want to go through the parade of some kind of dating situation first.  Essentially, they want to name a time, a place, have the woman show up, satisfy the man’s needs, and then she disappears.  Purely mechanical, without any socialisation aspect to it at all.  Another, less flattering, but undoubtedly more honest name for this arrangement is a booty call.  Of course, to put it in it’s plainest, most unflattering terms, what these men want is a prostitute…but they don’t want to pay for one.  They want sex without intimacy, without developing any kind of liking or interest in the other person beforehand.  It’s the sexual equivalent of fast food. \n Of course, some women are happy with this arrangement.  I haven’t personally met one yet, but I am sure they are out there.  Mind you, I am sure the real working girls must eye with disbelief, those who exchange sex for…..nothing.  I don’t know if they have a motto, but if they do, I am sure it is something like “If you’re going to get laid, then you might as well get paid!”. \n This is the point at which someone is going to accuse me of being overly moral, or prudish…or possibly immoral after making up that slogan. \n But seriously…isn’t it really kind of sad and pathetic when two human beings couple in a mechanical, animalistic way…without having any genuine liking or interest in the other person?  And if you are happy to walk away without a background glance afterwards,then don’t try and argue that there is genuine liking or interest.  All you really mean is the other person didn’t revolt you. \n Humans are naturally social animals.  There is the odd exception, but most hermits become that way after being revolted or horrified or disgusted by the other humans they interact with.  An emotionally healthy human being, with healthy contacts with other human beings does not become a hermit.  Some people don’t need a lot of interactions, as long as those they do have are of high quality.  But we all need some. \n Sexual pairings are one way to add to our level of social interaction.  Certainly the whole courtship dance, whether or not it is designed or destined to end in a permanent pairing, is quite an exciting social interaction.  The initial attraction, flirting, the build-up of sexual tension, the anticipation…all of these things add  value to our lives.   When we skip all of that, and cut straight to the mechanical aspect of sex, then we lose all that excitement…the whole adrenaline rush of courtship. \n This leads me to suspect that those who seek only a no-strings attached coupling (NSA sex) are unable to achieve intimacy.  I exempt those who are in a temporary state of damage; e.g. the person who is recently out of a bad relationship, for example.  But for someone who doesn’t have that excuse….someone who simply want to “f*ck and flee” on every occasion…there is something definitely wrong with them, because a healthy social animal doesn’t work that way. \n As I said, there seems to be a preponderance of them on online dating sites.  I suspect that what seems to be an excessive number may be in part due to them flooding any and all prospects with their enticing emails..”U r hott…want 2 hav sum fun?”.  But there are certainly far more of them then there should be. \n So, friends without benefits is, to my mind at least, a bad idea.  So, I would like to suggest an alternative…sex with benefits. \n It works this way..two people meet who are sexually attracted to one another.  Rather than running at one another like animals in rut, and then running away again after before there can possibly be any suggestion of any other kind of interaction, they take a whole new approach.  They both actually work at heightening the attraction.  They flirt, they do things like dancing (incredibly sexual activity), they learn how to seduce the other person’s mind (yes, seduction is actually very sexual…who’d have thought?), they create an environment where brushing the other person’s hand is enough to trigger that rush of excitement and thrills.  And then when the tension is at it’s height, then and only then take the steps to actually engage in the next level of intimacy…and do that in the expectation that sexual intimacy also takes time (more than one night please!) to build and heighten into something bigger and better. \n Ok, maybe this won’t result in a white wedding, house in the suburbs, and 2.4 kids.  I never said they would, and in fact those results actually have very little to do with emotional intimacy…in many cases, those things can directly destroy or more frequently lead to atrophy of that intimacy.  But maybe, if more people learnt how to focus on building that intimacy in the first place, then relationships would be better overall, and have a higher success rate. \n And if, to get back to my food metaphor, people ate a lot less fast food, and learnt how to cook their own gourmet meals in partnership with others…they have a far better chance of eating in style for life.  And if one cooking partnership falls apart after a while, then you are better situated to find a new cooking partner in future.  Less running from one fast food joint to another, and more long-term exploration and development of fine restaurants (if you are still hanging in with this metaphor, good for you!). \n Anyway I, and I am sure a lot of other people out there don’t want an endless chain of soulless sexual encounters.  We want sex…but with all the benefits that it can bring…social interaction, emotional satisfaction, and sometimes even, an actual relationship.  Because frankly, if we are going to treat sex like a business transaction…then we might as well be getting paid for it. \n I joined a new gym today.  For most of the twelve months, since relocating to attend university, I have worked out at home.  Functional, but not always that exciting.  I did try out the university gym for a couple of months, but since there was a definite his area/her area vibe going on (weight area/cardio area respectively), and since in any case there was only one set of hand weights under 10kg apiece, it didn’t maintain my attention for long. \n So…it’s been over twelve months since I have consistently worked out in a gym.  I picked this one for a couple of reasons.  Location first up – it’s located on the path between uni and home, so very hard to avoid.  Secondly, the hours.  It’s a 24 hour gym, which works right in with my study induced insomnia.  Thirdly, it’s brand-new.  This has multiple benefits.  One is that they were offering very tempting joining offers.  Two is that there will not be a core of long-term residents who consider they “own” the place.  Three is…chock full of brand new, state of the art equipment. \n By and large, I prefer free weights, primarily because you engage more muscles when using them.  Of course, machines that isolate muscles do have an important role to play, particularly for people with injuries, who wish to consider training without causing further damage to a specific area.  And of course, when you train regularly, using machines can help to break up routines, and eliminate monotony. \n So, I am intrigued by the range of new designs this gym holds.   Since I don’t work out of a gym, I haven’t really kept up with the latest and greatest designs in machines, and obviously, I am going to be broadening my knowledge base in that regard. \n So, the next few weeks are going to be  interesting, as I find my way about this place, and more importantly, work out a whole new routine…and hopefully find some interesting things to write about. \n First sports medicine class on taping techniques yesterday.  After a session on how to do it right, we were all armed with tape, and directed to team up with someone else.  Being lucky that way, I ended up with two somebody else’s, and since I had already been nominated to be the first victim…er, patient…this meant I had both ankles being taped at the same time.  Just as well I wore running pants to the class. \n The moment of entertainment for me, was when the assistant tutor came to check my two classmates’ technique.  She is twenty something, and currently on crutches as a result of ankle surgery.  Blithely she asks me what ankle injuries I have sustained in my life.  Just as blithely, I answered none.  She looked at me…hard.  “Never?” she asks? “Nope” I replied.  All around me are my fellow students, many of them considerably younger than me.  Having not much to do while my ankles were strapped up, I had been eavesdropping on conversations all around me.  The class was riddled with all these healthy young things, whose ankle joints appear to be on the point of needing replacement.  And here am I, well, not ancient, but not twenty-something either, freely jumping up and down to prove just how great my ankles are.  It was a happy moment. \n Just as well she didn’t ask me about my knees… \n Well, this is my first post in a while.  Blame it on life.  Prep classes before the uni semester started again, and of course, getting into the swing of the new semester.  Not to mention starting a new part-time job, and of course, getting the munchkin organised into various sporting activities.  It’s been hectic. \n However, I finally found myself with time today to take a breath, and actually logged in here to see what’s been happening (aka, has anyone continued to visit my blog while it’s been static?).  Which, I am happy to say has been happening, and has cheered me immensely, and given me the boot in the pants to get started again. \n My courses this semester include functional anatomy, and sports medicine, so I am sure they are going to jumpstart me in many new directions.  In addition, I continue to pursue the cause of clean and healthy food. \n So here’s crossing my fingers that I get the ball rolling smoothly again.  And start writing something of substance.  😀 \n Enter

web-cam options though.  So the first clue, is when a man (or woman) becomes very urgent in their desire to talk to you on Messenger, Yahoo, Skype, etc.   A red flag that, curiously enough, they share with scammers.\nOnce they exchange ids with you, and open up a chat window in this new platform, the next question is “Can you turn on your web-cam?”.    If you – wisely – demur to comply, the chances are, after some token protest, that they will accept your choice, but still insist on opening up their web-cam.\nNow, some of them will initially appear clothed.  Or at least, the portion of them that you can see is clothed.  If they are bare-chested, unless they appear to be sitting on a beach, where the passerbys are all wearing beach-style clothing, it is best to assume the nudity is total.\nIt doesn’t take them long to get down to business (strange how I always considered business and fun to be at different ends of the spectrum!), and they will either invite you to view them (au naturale), ask you if you want to play a little, or if you want to watch them play a little.  If you again demur, they will then trot out the magic phrase “Aw, it’s just having a bit of fun!”.\nSeriously?  Watching some guy you barely/don’t  know jerk off, is fun?  Since when?\nSome of them don’t even ask first, but instead suddenly redirect the direction of their webcam in the direction of their genitalia, where they are already “playing”.  Presumably, they think that under those circumstances, you will be so enthralled by the sight of their appendage, that you will become glued to the screen, and pant along with them.  \nEEEWWWW!!!\nTo the men that engage in this behaviour, or even try to entice women to play along, I have to say…this is NOT fun.  What this is, is crass, crude, vulgar and quite often disgusting and totally abhorent.   While an existing couple, in a loving relationship may choose to use internet sex as a way to maintain their relationship if temporarily separated, when it is a virtual stranger, then it is no better than having a man come up to you in the street, and expose himself to you.  \nYes, guys, you are that dirty old man, in a dirty raincoat, flashing himself to strangers, in order to satisfy a perverse craving.  There is nothing “fun” about what you are doing, at all.  Women are not thrilled or turned on, seeing your naked penis.  You think we’ve never seen one before?  You think we might actually be impressed?  We might laugh at you and your rabid self-delusion – which is about as much fun as we will get from this situation – but we are never, ever impressed.\nI want the men/boys/perverts who consider this behaviour “fun” to find a dictionary, and check on the definition of the word.  I then want them to think back to their childhood, to that point where someone must have explained to them, that when you do something that hurts/upsets/disgusts/repels another person, no matter how much enjoyment you may personally gain from engaging in these actions, what you are doing is not fun, and is not acceptable behaviour.  Guys, is that what really turns you on?  Disgusting and revolting another human being?  If so, then you need serious therapy.\nI want the word fun given back to people who actually know how to have fun.  I don’t want to have to cringe, every time I talk to a man online, and he asks me if I want to have fun – I want to genuinely believe he is talking about inviting me out on a fun date, or something equally innocuous.  I don’t want to dread being asked if I have a webcam…I want to know that when someone asks to talk on webcam it’s because they want to genuinely see me as a person (and possibly to check I’m not posting fake photos).  When a man asks me if I want to watch him play online, I want him to mean he is playing a musical instrument.\nBecause, to me, none of these things are fun, or playing, or having a good time.  What they are, is a man who is virtually a stranger to me, engaging in seriously deviant behaviour, that would get him arrested if he did it in person.  Being separated by the internet does not give someone licence to be a sex offender.\n \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t__ATA.cmd.push(function() {\n\t\t\t\t\t__ATA.initDynamicSlot({\n\t\t\t\t\t\tid: 'atatags-26942-60a7904e71963',\n\t\t\t\t\t\tlocation:

of friends with benefits.  There has even been a movie recently made on the topic, which, being a romantic comedy, romanticises the notion, and of course, implies that such a course is not doomed to disaster.\nThe tv series, Boston Legal, also visited the subject with two of their longer-running characters.  Of course, the fact that the woman in question was a very assertive, strong woman, who controlled the connection (at one point, she had two such “friends” at the same time) and that the main friend was in love with her made the whole scenario rather untrue to life.\nI know people who have walked that path.  In most cases it has led to disaster.  Way too many women think that if they go along with it, eventually the man in question will be smitten by their charms and will lay his heart at their feet.  In a couple of cases, it has worked out ok, but only when both people seriously do not want any more than a purely sexual arrangement, and both have eventually gone their separate ways quite happily.  But I personally, don’t know anyone that started off with that arrangement, and ended up together happily ever after.  No doubt it has happened, somewhere, to someone…but I would be very surprised if anyone could prove it to be a statistical probability.\nSo, what is friends with benefits?  It is theoretically, an arrangement where two single people agree to meet sexual needs with each other, without all the hassle of a commitment of any kind (including something as harmless as boyfriend/girlfriend).  In essence, there are no promises, no guarantees, and either party is free to walk at any time guilt-free.  It sounds very mature, practical and modern, doesn’t it?\nPersonally, since it is called friends with benefits, my literal assumption would be that the two people concerned were aquaintances, with common bonds and ties of friendship, and some background of liking and respect for one another.  Under those circumstances, and with suitable levels of sexual attraction for one another, and a background of social interaction which might or might not lead to sex on any given occasion, I could almost see this as being an eminently practical solution for many singles.\nThere is a problem though.\nMany, many people who announce they want friends with benefits publicly – i.e. dating sites – are men…mostly very young men.  But for those who actually spell it out, they are not looking for any kind of friendship, or bond or social interaction with the opposite gender.  They just want to have sex without any kind of connection at all.  Most of them don’t even want to go through the parade of some kind of dating situation first.  Essentially, they want to name a time, a place, have the woman show up, satisfy the man’s needs, and then she disappears.  Purely mechanical, without any socialisation aspect to it at all.  Another, less flattering, but undoubtedly more honest name for this arrangement is a booty call.  Of course, to put it in it’s plainest, most unflattering terms, what these men want is a prostitute…but they don’t want to pay for one.  They want sex without intimacy, without developing any kind of liking or interest in the other person beforehand.  It’s the sexual equivalent of fast food.\nOf course, some women are happy with this arrangement.  I haven’t personally met one yet, but I am sure they are out there.  Mind you, I am sure the real working girls must eye with disbelief, those who exchange sex for…..nothing.  I don’t know if they have a motto, but if they do, I am sure it is something like “If you’re going to get laid, then you might as well get paid!”.\nThis is the point at which someone is going to accuse me of being overly moral, or prudish…or possibly immoral after making up that slogan.\nBut seriously…isn’t it really kind of sad and pathetic when two human beings couple in a mechanical, animalistic way…without having any genuine liking or interest in the other person?  And if you are happy to walk away without a background glance afterwards,then don’t try and argue that there is genuine liking or interest.  All you really mean is the other person didn’t revolt you.\nHumans are naturally social animals.  There is the odd exception, but most hermits become that way after being revolted or horrified or disgusted by the other humans they interact with.  An emotionally healthy human being, with healthy contacts with other human beings does not become a hermit.  Some people don’t need a lot of interactions, as long as those they do have are of high quality.  But we all need some.\nSexual pairings are one way to add to our level of social interaction.  Certainly the whole courtship dance, whether or not it is designed or destined to end in a permanent pairing, is quite an exciting social interaction.  The initial attraction, flirting, the build-up of sexual tension, the anticipation…all of these things add  value to our lives.   When we skip all of that, and cut straight to the mechanical aspect of sex, then we lose all that excitement…the whole adrenaline rush of courtship.\nThis leads me to suspect that those who seek only a no-strings attached coupling (NSA sex) are unable to achieve intimacy.  I exempt those who are in a temporary state of damage; e.g. the person who is recently out of a bad relationship, for example.  But for someone who doesn’t have that excuse….someone who simply want to “f*ck and flee” on every occasion…there is something definitely wrong with them, because a healthy social animal doesn’t work that way.\nAs I said, there seems to be a preponderance of them on online dating sites.  I suspect that what seems to be an excessive number may be in part due to them flooding any and all prospects with their enticing emails..”U r hott…want 2 hav sum fun?”.  But there are certainly far more of them then there should be.\nSo, friends without benefits is, to my mind at least, a bad idea.  So, I would like to suggest an alternative…sex with benefits.\nIt works this way..two people meet who are sexually attracted to one another.  Rather than running at one another like animals in rut, and then running away again after before there can possibly be any suggestion of any other kind of interaction, they take a whole new approach.  They both actually work at heightening the attraction.  They flirt, they do things like dancing (incredibly sexual activity), they learn how to seduce the other person’s mind (yes, seduction is actually very sexual…who’d have thought?), they create an environment where brushing the other person’s hand is enough to trigger that rush of excitement and thrills.  And then when the tension is at it’s height, then and only then take the steps to actually engage in the next level of intimacy…and do that in the expectation that sexual intimacy also takes time (more than one night please!) to build and heighten into something bigger and better.\nOk, maybe this won’t result in a white wedding, house in the suburbs, and 2.4 kids.  I never said they would, and in fact those results actually have very little to do with emotional intimacy…in many cases, those things can directly destroy or more frequently lead to atrophy of that intimacy.  But maybe, if more people learnt how to focus on building that intimacy in the first place, then relationships would be better overall, and have a higher success rate.\nAnd if, to get back to my food metaphor, people ate a lot less fast food, and learnt how to cook their own gourmet meals in partnership with others…they have a far better chance of eating in style for life.  And if one cooking partnership falls apart after a while, then you are better situated to find a new cooking partner in future.  Less running from one fast food joint to another, and more long-term exploration and development of fine restaurants (if you are still hanging in with this metaphor, good for you!).\nAnyway I, and I am sure a lot of other people out there don’t want an endless chain of soulless sexual encounters.  We want sex…but with all the benefits that it can bring…social interaction, emotional satisfaction, and sometimes even, an actual relationship.  Because frankly, if we are going to treat sex like a business transaction…then we might as well be getting paid for it.\n\n        \n            __ATA.cmd.push(function() {\n

\n \n\t\n\t\tBack to the coal face – a.k.a. gym\n\n\t\t\n\t\tPosted on March 12, 2011 by redfyre\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\tI joined a new gym today.  For most of the twelve months, since relocating to attend university, I have worked out at home.  Functional, but not always that exciting.  I did try out the university gym for a couple of months, but since there was a definite his area/her area vibe going on (weight area/cardio area respectively), and since in any case there was only one set of hand weights under 10kg apiece, it didn’t maintain my attention for long.\nSo…it’s been over twelve months since I have consistently worked out in a gym.  I picked this one for a couple of reasons.  Location first up – it’s located on the path between uni and home, so very hard to avoid.  Secondly, the hours.  It’s a 24 hour gym, which works right in with my study induced insomnia.  Thirdly, it’s brand-new.  This has multiple benefits.  One is that they were offering very tempting joining offers.  Two is that there will not be a core of long-term residents who consider they “own” the place.  Three is…chock full of brand new, state of the art equipment.\nBy and large, I prefer free weights, primarily because you engage more muscles when using them.  Of course, machines that isolate muscles do have an important role to play, particularly for people with injuries, who wish to consider training without causing further damage to a specific area.  And of course, when you train regularly, using machines can help to break up routines, and eliminate monotony.\nSo, I am intrigued by the range of new designs this gym holds.   Since I don’t work out of a gym, I haven’t really kept up with the latest and greatest designs in machines, and obviously, I am going to be broadening my knowledge base in that regard.\nSo, the next few weeks are going to be  interesting, as I find my way about this place, and more importantly, work out a whole new routine…and hopefully find some interesting things to write about.\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tPosted in Exercise \u0026 Fitness\t\t | \n\t\tTagged exercise, fitness, health, personal trainers, personal training, postaday2011 | \t\tLeave a

session on how to do it right, we were all armed with tape, and directed to team up with someone else.  Being lucky that way, I ended up with two somebody else’s, and since I had already been nominated to be the first victim…er, patient…this meant I had both ankles being taped at the same time.  Just as well I wore running pants to the class.\nThe moment of entertainment for me, was when the assistant tutor came to check my two classmates’ technique.  She is twenty something, and currently on crutches as a result of ankle surgery.  Blithely she asks me what ankle injuries I have sustained in my life.  Just as blithely, I answered none.  She looked at me…hard.  “Never?” she asks? “Nope” I replied.  All around me are my fellow students, many of them considerably younger than me.  Having not much to do while my ankles were strapped up, I had been eavesdropping on conversations all around me.  The class was riddled with all these healthy young things, whose ankle joints appear to be on the point of needing replacement.  And here am I, well, not ancient, but not twenty-something either, freely jumping up and down to prove just how great my ankles are.  It was a happy moment.\nJust as well she didn’t ask me about my knees…\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tPosted in Exercise \u0026 Fitness\t\t | \n\t\tTagged exercise, fitness, health, joint strapping, joint taping, lifestyle,

in a while.  Blame it on life.  Prep classes before the uni semester started again, and of course, getting into the swing of the new semester.  Not to mention starting a new part-time job, and of course, getting the munchkin organised into various sporting activities.  It’s been hectic.\nHowever, I finally found myself with time today to take a breath, and actually logged in here to see what’s been happening (aka, has anyone continued to visit my blog while it’s been static?).  Which, I am happy to say has been happening, and has cheered me immensely, and given me the boot in the pants to get started again.\nMy courses this semester include functional anatomy, and sports medicine, so I am sure they are going to jumpstart me in many new directions.  In addition, I continue to pursue the cause of clean and healthy food.\nSo here’s crossing my fingers that I get the ball rolling smoothly again.  And start writing something of substance.  😀\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\tPosted in

With assistance from our expert sales staff, we will educate you on your options to ensure you find a stove that will compliment your home.\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nOUR GOAL\nTo serve Fort Collins and the surrounding areas with the highest quality fireplace products and service\n \nStoves are no longer considered old-fashioned appliances. New heating stoves, whether they are wood, gas, pellet, or electric, are highly efficient, beautiful, and are engineered with innovative technological features that every modern homeowner wants. These highly effective heating units can produce the same amount of heat with less firewood, are 50% more energy efficient than earlier versions, and produce 70% less particle pollution. Homeowners can enjoy a number of wonderful benefits when they choose to install a wood, gas, pellet, or electric stove. Contemporary stoves offer increased versatility and have fewer installation requirements so these hearth appliances can often be installed in rooms or spaces where a traditional fireplace would not be practical. Stoves also act as an effective means to zone heat the busiest rooms of your home during the cold winter months. Use your stove as a supplement to your central heating \u0026 turn down your furnace so you can enjoy savings on your utility bills each winter.\n \n \n \n \n\n\nOur expansive showroom features a beautiful display of wood stoves, gas stoves, pellet stoves, and electric stoves so you can view your favorite brands side by side. Speak with our fireplace \u0026 stove experts to find out which unit will perfectly suit your heating needs \u0026 lifestyle.\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nLearn More\n\n \n\n\n\nWood Stoves\n \nWood burning stoves have truly been a staple in households across that nation for decades. They have become valuable assets thanks to their high heat efficiency, new innovative technology \u0026 designs, and high quality construction. When centrally located, a modern EPA certified wood stove can effectively heat an entire home as large as 3,500 sq. ft. Visit our store in Fort Collins CO to browse stoves made from cast iron, steel, or soapstone construction, choose your favorite features, then select whether you prefer top-loading, front-loading, or side-loading.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nLearn More\n\n \n\n\n\nGas Stoves\n \nFree-standing gas stoves are an excellent choice for homeowners who enjoy the ambiance and warmth of a fire, but don’t want the leg work of chopping, storing \u0026 stack firewood or tending to a fire constantly. With the flip of a switch, gas stoves will ignite, producing warm dancing flames. Whether you are looking for a decorative room feature or an effective \u0026 efficient heat source, a gas stove is the perfect choice. Choose from direct vent or vent-free gas stove units, depending on the space you wish to install your new stove. Enjoy all the benefits of a fire without the hassle and upkeep of a wood stove.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nLearn More\n\n \n\n\n\nPellet Stoves\n \nPellet stoves offer an eco-friendly way to heat your home this winter. These highly efficient heating alternatives put out a lot of heat and run on a renewable, recycled fuel, known as wood pellets. Whether you are looking to cut your heating bills or reduce your environmental impact, a pellet stove is the perfect option. These units produce a steady heat and are easy to use, adding to their list of attractive features. Homeowners can enjoy a wood fueled fire but will not need to constantly tend to \u0026 keep up with the fire, unlike a wood burning stove.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nResidents from Fort Collins CO, Boulder, Cheyenne WY, Laramie WY, Longmont, Greeley, and the surrounding areas in Boulder County, Weld County, and Larimer County travel to our wonderfully stocked showroom in Fort Collins to view the best selection of wood, gas, pellet, and electric stoves on the market.\n \n \n \n \n\n\n\nMessage Us\nGet in touch below.

  "inline_text": "Mine certainly didn’t.  She did eat a lot of things that are now frowned upon, in quantities that defy the government approved dietary principles of today.  And yet strangely enough, she was thin as a rake her entire life, and pretty healthy too.  And her diet didn’t kill her; that was the shock of losing her only daughter that made her give up living.  It was her mind that killed her, not her food. \n So what did Grandma eat?  I spent nearly all my school holidays with her as a teenager, so I am well-versed in that subject. \n Lamb was pretty popular.  She’d cook up chops in a casserole, and that would last several nights in a row.  This is old fashioned lamb too; not the heart smart, lean cuts.  Sausages were also popular – and they weren’t anything fancy either.  She usually had take-away once a week; either fish and chips, or fried chicken, chips, and a pineapple fritter, cooked by her local store…not a chain fast-food restaurant. \n She ate mashed potato, nearly every night, made with full-cream milk and butter.  She used a lot of butter in her cooking.  She ate toast with butter and Vegemite for breakfast most mornings.  Lunch varied; sometimes a sandwich, sometimes leftovers.  She never threw food out; always ate it up. \n So, what didn’t she eat? \n Not a lot of bread…a loaf would easily last her one week.  Never pasta, and rice was something that turned up in a rice pudding, not a risotto.  She didn’t eat plastic food – the kind of food that has a list of ingredients on the label, half of which are created in laboratories.  She didn’t drink soft drink/soda…it was either tea or water.  And the water came out of a rainwater tank, which always had a faint tang of kerosene (which she used to pour on top to kill mosquitoes).  She didn’t eat breakfast cereal, aside from porridge/oats in the winter, and so avoided all the sugars and flavourings used to make modern cereals attractive. \n She grew some of her own food; raspberries, and almonds and tomatoes and beans and peas – I will always remember helping her to shell big bowlfuls of peas.  She made some of her own jams too; apricot and plum, and would sometimes make tomato sauce too, if the crop was plentiful.  She never bought commercially made cake. \n Her diet wasn’t exciting, or rich with the food of other cultures, or balanced according to a government promoted guideline.  It was plain,and plentiful, and real.  A bit of bread, some meat, potatoes,  a few different vegetables, a bit of fruit.  Full cream milk, full-fat butter, and white cooking fat if she was frying something.  She walked her dog for a couple of miles every morning, and spent a couple of hours per week in her garden.  She was quite healthy for all but the last two years of her life, which considering she didn’t undertake weight-bearing exercise to strengthen her bones, or maintain muscle tissue was fairly remarkable…or it would be today.  Back when I was young, and spending time with her, most of her counterparts were also in reasonably good health.  Heavily overweight people were rare – the morbidly obese we see today were virtually non-existent then.  And yet we consider our diets to be so much better today? \n There are lessons to be learned here. \n The answer is simple…you can’t!  Well, short of very expensive plastic surgery. \n There has been a tv ad running recently, in which this man talks about his wonderful weight loss system, and confides that he conducted a survey of 8000 participants in this system, who allegedly achieved an average weight loss of 6 kilos per week.    I am assuming that most of them had died (and putrefaction was lowering the weight of the corpse) or they had their legs bitten off by sharks, or something of that nature..or a lot of them had liposuction. \n The thing is, whenever someone makes claims like this, refuse to beleive a word of it until you have perused an authenticated (by you, not them) independent study, conducted according to approved scientific protocols.  Aneccdotal evidence (i.e.” my clients have told me this!”) is not scientific or legitimate.  or to put it another way…if anyone had devised a way that consistently enabled people to lose an average of 6 kilos in one week, they would be begging reputable scientists in the exercise physiology/dietetics fields to verify these results, because then that person would patent the method and become a billionaire overnight.  This man is just working on becoming a millionaire by manipulating and deceiving the unwary and desperate into handing over money. \n Current scientific thinking tells us that the optimum overall fat loss goal per week is 0.5-1 kilos (1-2 pound).  One of the reasons for this is that there is a physiological reaction to losing fat too quickly.  Those pesky cells we have, decide that we are starving and swing into action to conserve whatever body fat you still have, as well as valuable muscle tissue, and fat loss comes to a screaming halt.  The optimal amounts are precisely those, because they fly under the cells’ radar, and they will let you get away with it. \n There is also the fact that you didn’t put the fat on that quickly…it was a slow process (if you tried to gain six kilos in a week, you would be gorging yourself on extremely high-calorie, unhealthy foods, and your body would reject them; i.e. you’d make yourself ill).  So, it has to be an equally steady and consistent process to remove the fat.  You also have to factor in, that in an effective fat-loss program, it includes changes to both eating and exercise habits. \n Then there is the muscle tissue aspect.  The more you have (obtained through resistance training) the more calories your body needs to burn to maintain each day (effectively increasing your metabolic rate).  Conversely, when you expend energy (calories) too quickly, some of them come from your muscle tissue, rather than from your body fat.  Hence, you lower your metabolic rate, and make it even harder to lose more weight. \n Weight loss is simple; eliminate most, if not all processed food from your diet; get your carbohydrates from vegetable sources; eat lean organic meat (that hasn’t been pumped full of growth hormones) minimise sugar intake (never, ever, EVER eat artificial substitutes; use raw sugar, stevia or honey where sweetening is required), avoid corn syrup like the plague (you do realise corn is what beef-lot cattle are fed, as it fattens them more quickly?), learn to read labels on food packaging.  Then incorporate more physical movement into your life, on a daily basis.  And preferably make it part of your life, not something you see as a chore.  Make good lifestyle changes and fat loss will follow in the footsteps of those changes. \n   \n But forget about massive overall weight loss in just one week…unless you are so desperate to look lighter on the scales that you really will offer your leg to a shark! \n This is for both genders…no-one is exempt! \n I have become quite taken by a song by country singer Shea Fisher, titled  “Don’t chase me (‘less you’re willing to catch me)”.  In the murky waters of dating and relationships, I believe she has a quite valid point to make. \n For some people – too many people – the search for the One has resulted in a long and messy trail of first-and-only dates, short-term relationships, and what seems to be rising levels of infidelity (both men and women) within marriages. \n I think relationships are yet another casualty of our retail mentality.  Which is too say, we do a lot of window shopping, cruising from store to store, trying on one person after another, and throwing them aside because they are not “perfect” for us. \n Now, I am the last to advocate settling for someone you don’t love deeply.  Settling is a very, very bad thing.  But what I am saying is that if you find someone who is close to your ideal, then actually give them a chance.  Stop making every little thing on your “perfect partner” list into a deal-breaker.  And bear something else in mind – if you do find someone, who is perfect is every respect…what makes you think that YOU live up to their standard of perfection?  Yes, it does work both ways. \n Being single, I have my fair share of those one-and-only dates.  Some of them are one-and-only for very good reasons.  Like the guy I met for lunch, who proclaimed himself to be a spirit healer, and then tried to use that to persuade me that I needed to listen to the spirits (through him) and become his lover (yes, this is over a LUNCH date!) in an open-ended relationship.  Open-ended because the spirits had told him he would be meeting his soul mate later in the year, so he couldn’t commit to anyone else.  Er, yes.  The point being, if you meet a loser, nutcase or anyone else waving red flags, run for the hills.  If they are so boring you would gnaw your own arm off to get away, then say “thanks so much, wish you luck in your search, goodbye”. \n But if he or she is most of the way there, but just not your laundry list heart-throb…for heavens sake, give them a chance.  At least 3-4 dates in different environments just to see if they do have potential as a person.  After all, if not your one and only, perhaps they might make a really great friend (and one whom you can then set up with your single friends).  Consider it to be networking.  And remember there is no possible way for someone’s great qualities to all emerge in the course of one date. \n We create a great deal of misery and loneliness for ourselves because of the way we approach dating.  We often have unrealistic expectations of the other person, and are subsequently disappointed when they fail to perform as we had visualised.  Remember, they are a person too, and may be as nervous as you (or even more nervous!).  Also, there is a tendency to behave differently on a first date – trying to be the person you think the other person wants you to be (this ties into the whole expectation thing). \n So essentially, what I am urging is this…try and get past the first-and-only date block.  Give them three or four to allow you to find out more about them.  Treat them as a person and not a commodity.  Dating is meant to be a process of getting to know someone…not making snap judgments. \n I have read many articles about how people behave differently online.  In many cases, the anonymity of an online profile frees one up from the consequences of speaking inadvisedly.  This has then encouraged some people to be deliberately provocative in what they say, knowing they will never personally be called to account.

quantities that defy the government approved dietary principles of today.  And yet strangely enough, she was thin as a rake her entire life, and pretty healthy too.  And her diet didn’t kill her; that was the shock of losing her only daughter that made her give up living.  It was her mind that killed her, not her food.\nSo what did Grandma eat?  I spent nearly all my school holidays with her as a teenager, so I am well-versed in that subject.\nLamb was pretty popular.  She’d cook up chops in a casserole, and that would last several nights in a row.  This is old fashioned lamb too; not the heart smart, lean cuts.  Sausages were also popular – and they weren’t anything fancy either.  She usually had take-away once a week; either fish and chips, or fried chicken, chips, and a pineapple fritter, cooked by her local store…not a chain fast-food restaurant.\nShe ate mashed potato, nearly every night, made with full-cream milk and butter.  She used a lot of butter in her cooking.  She ate toast with butter and Vegemite for breakfast most mornings.  Lunch varied; sometimes a sandwich, sometimes leftovers.  She never threw food out; always ate it up.\nSo, what didn’t she eat?\nNot a lot of bread…a loaf would easily last her one week.  Never pasta, and rice was something that turned up in a rice pudding, not a risotto.  She didn’t eat plastic food – the kind of food that has a list of ingredients on the label, half of which are created in laboratories.  She didn’t drink soft drink/soda…it was either tea or water.  And the water came out of a rainwater tank, which always had a faint tang of kerosene (which she used to pour on top to kill mosquitoes).  She didn’t eat breakfast cereal, aside from porridge/oats in the winter, and so avoided all the sugars and flavourings used to make modern cereals attractive.\nShe grew some of her own food; raspberries, and almonds and tomatoes and beans and peas – I will always remember helping her to shell big bowlfuls of peas.  She made some of her own jams too; apricot and plum, and would sometimes make tomato sauce too, if the crop was plentiful.  She never bought commercially made cake.\nHer diet wasn’t exciting, or rich with the food of other cultures, or balanced according to a government promoted guideline.  It was plain,and plentiful, and real.  A bit of bread, some meat, potatoes,  a few different vegetables, a bit of fruit.  Full cream milk, full-fat butter, and white cooking fat if she was frying something.  She walked her dog for a couple of miles every morning, and spent a couple of hours per week in her garden.  She was quite healthy for all but the last two years of her life, which considering she didn’t undertake weight-bearing exercise to strengthen her bones, or maintain muscle tissue was fairly

on January 24, 2011 by redfyre\t\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\tThe answer is simple…you can’t!  Well, short of very expensive plastic surgery.\nThere has been a tv ad running recently, in which this man talks about his wonderful weight loss system, and confides that he conducted a survey of 8000 participants in this system, who allegedly achieved an average weight loss of 6 kilos per week.    I am assuming that most of them had died (and putrefaction was lowering the weight of the corpse) or they had their legs bitten off by sharks, or something of that nature..or a lot of them had liposuction.\nThe thing is, whenever someone makes claims like this, refuse to beleive a word of it until you have perused an authenticated (by you, not them) independent study, conducted according to approved scientific protocols.  Aneccdotal evidence (i.e.” my clients have told me this!”) is not scientific or legitimate.  or to put it another way…if anyone had devised a way that consistently enabled people to lose an average of 6 kilos in one week, they would be begging reputable scientists in the exercise physiology/dietetics fields to verify these results, because then that person would patent the method and become a billionaire overnight.  This man is just working on becoming a millionaire by manipulating and deceiving the unwary and desperate into handing over money.\nCurrent scientific thinking tells us that the optimum overall fat loss goal per week is 0.5-1 kilos (1-2 pound).  One of the reasons for this is that there is a physiological reaction to losing fat too quickly.  Those pesky cells we have, decide that we are starving and swing into action to conserve whatever body fat you still have, as well as valuable muscle tissue, and fat loss comes to a screaming halt.  The optimal amounts are precisely those, because they fly under the cells’ radar, and they will let you get away with it.\nThere is also the fact that you didn’t put the fat on that quickly…it was a slow process (if you tried to gain six kilos in a week, you would be gorging yourself on extremely high-calorie, unhealthy foods, and your body would reject them; i.e. you’d make yourself ill).  So, it has to be an equally steady and consistent process to remove the fat.  You also have to factor in, that in an effective fat-loss program, it includes changes to both eating and exercise habits.\nThen there is the muscle tissue aspect.  The more you have (obtained through resistance training) the more calories your body needs to burn to maintain each day (effectively increasing your metabolic rate).  Conversely, when you expend energy (calories) too quickly, some of them come from your muscle tissue, rather than from your body fat.  Hence, you lower your metabolic rate, and make it even harder to lose more weight.\nWeight loss is simple; eliminate most, if not all processed food from your diet; get your carbohydrates from vegetable sources; eat lean organic meat (that hasn’t been pumped full of growth hormones) minimise sugar intake (never, ever, EVER eat artificial substitutes; use raw sugar, stevia or honey where sweetening is required), avoid corn syrup like the plague (you

 And preferably make it part of your life, not something you see as a chore.  Make good lifestyle changes and fat loss will follow in the footsteps of those changes.\n \nBut forget about massive overall weight loss in just one week…unless you are so desperate to look lighter on the scales that you really will offer your leg to a shark!\n\n        \n            __ATA.cmd.push(function() {\n

Gain the calming scent and incredible ambiance of a fireplace while having the added benefits of a stove that acts like a furnace. A wood stove can serve as a gathering place to enjoy the flickering flames and heat of a fire that also lowers heating costs and reduces your environmental footprint. \n Wood stoves are highly efficient and can potentially heat an entire house with the right unit. This is due in part to the elevated heat output that emanates from all sides of the stove and not just the front like a traditional fireplace. Wood stoves also work without the need for electricity, providing both heat and a way to cook should the electricity go out during the harsh winter months. \n Unlike wood stoves of the past, more recent models are EPA certified to meet the high standards of air quality. Newer wood stoves, due to their enhanced design, produce very few emissions. This advanced technology allows the harmful byproducts produced by fire to be burned up rather than be released into the environment. Wood-burning stoves are further environmentally friendly as it uses firewood, which is a renewable resource, as its fuel source. \n Wood stoves come in a wide variety of designs that can fit in with your personal taste and style from rustic to urban or traditional to modern. These stoves are typically made from one of three materials: soapstone, steel and cast iron, each with their own advantages depending on what you are looking for. Soapstone stores and maintains consistent heat the best but takes the longest to heat up and cool down. Steel heats up and cools down the quickest. Cast iron is the classic and popular choice that can have a simple to very ornate design in addition to a cooktop. \n We would love to help you select the right stove to fit your needs.

  "inline_text": " \n Call Showroom \n  \n Call Service \n  \n Send Message \n Gas stoves provide the heat output of a furnace and the look of a wood burning stove but without the added work needed for a wood burning stove. Gas stoves are a convenient and easy alternative to wood stoves as there is very little maintenance needed. Gas stoves also work without the need for electricity, providing both heat and a way to cook should the electricity go out during cold, winter months. \n Gas stoves have very high efficiency heat output and minimal heat loss, keeping your home nice and cozy when you need it. These types of stoves are also a good alternative heating source that is environmentally friendly and cost effect at the same time. Gas stoves allow you to zone-heat the rooms you use the most rather than wasting heat on your entire home. Very little maintenance is needed with gas stoves as there is no need to chop and store wood. The only maintenance required is a yearly checkup to ensure that the unit is in proper working order. \n There is a wide array of styles and customizable options available from traditional to modern. Gas stoves allow more control over the heat through a remote control or thermostat. Additionally, you can control the amount of heat and the size of the flames from the remote control. Choose from artificial logs or stones or accent lighting to make your gas stove fit seamlessly in with your existing décor. \n To vent your gas stove, there are two venting options to choose from. The direct vent offers a more authentic and dynamic flame because of the air drawn in from the outside through a vent which provides increased oxygen levels in the stove. A direct vent also greatly reduces the risk for monoxide poisoning. Vent-free models are available if a homeowners prefers a unit that produces more heat and more vibrant flames. Local codes and regulations will determine whether or not vent free gas stoves are eligible to be installed in your home. \n We would love to help you select the right kind of clean-burning stove that offers real flames without the hassle and upkeep of a wood stove. Stop by our showroom in Fort Collins, CO to have one of our experts show you the makes and models that we have available. \n \nName\n\n \n \nEmail Address\n\n \n \nMessage\n\n \n 4631 S.
